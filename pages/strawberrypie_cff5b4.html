    <h1>Strawberry Pie</h1>
    <p>9 inch baked pie shell or graham cracker crust 6 cups strawberries 1 cup sugar 3 TBS cornstarch ½ cup water 1 pkg (3 oz) cream cheese, softened  Mash enough strawberries to make 1 cup.  Mix sugar and cornstarch in 2 qt saucepan. Gradually stir in water and mashed strawberries.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils.  Boil and stir for one minute.  Cool.  Beat cream cheese smooth and spread on bottom of pie shell.  Fill graham cracker crust with remaining strawberries.  Pour cooled strawberry mixture over top.  Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.  8 servings, 320 calories per serving.  Can use peaches or raspberries instead of strawberries. (For peaches, to prevent discoloration, dip peaches in an ascorbic acid mixture.)  Note: I usually leave out the cream cheese and I have often used peaches without the ascorbic acid… this recipe makes a great peach pie.</p>
<p>Note: Cream cheese can help the graham cracker crust last longer. Also, lemon juice works well for the peach pie instead of ascorbic acid. No problems with color changing and it still tastes great!</p>

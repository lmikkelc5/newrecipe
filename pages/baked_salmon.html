    <h1>Baked Salmon</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>1 ½ - 3 tablespoons light olive oil</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon dried basil</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</p>
        <p>3 (6 ounce) filets salmon</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1.   	In a medium glass bowl, prepare marinade by mixing garlic, light olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley. Place salmon fillets in a medium glass baking dish, and cover with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator about 1 hour, turning occasionally.  (I didn’t have time to marinate and it was still yummy.)</li>
        <li>2.   	Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>3.   	Place fillets in aluminum foil, cover with marinade, and seal.  (I didn’t have any foil the first time I made it, and it worked fine uncovered.) Place sealed salmon in the glass dish, and bake 35 to 45 minutes, until easily flaked with a fork.</li>

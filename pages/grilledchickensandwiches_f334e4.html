    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board and lightly cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Use the flat side of a meat mallet to pound chicken breasts to ½-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl or freezer bag. Add chicken and toss</li>
        <li>well to combine. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat (375°F). 4. Remove the chicken from the marinade allowing excess to drip off and discard</li>
        <li>the marinade.</li>
        <li>5. Add the chicken to the grill and cook for 5-6 minutes per side or until no pink</li>
        <li>remains and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>
        <li>6. While chicken is cooking, brush the cut side of the buns with olive oil and place</li>
        <li>face down on the grill. Cook until lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>7. Spread each bun with honey mustard and add lettuce, tomatoes and onions if</li>
        <li>desired. Top with chicken and serve.</li>
        <li>Notes -If your chicken breasts are larger, they can be cut to make 4 portions. -Do not overcook the chicken, it is pounded to cook evenly and only needs about 10-12 minutes. -Chicken breasts can be replaced with boneless skinless chicken thighs. -Homemade Honey Mustard: Combine ⅓ cup mayonnaise, 1 ½ tablespoons yellow mustard, 1 ½ tablespoons honey &  ½ teaspoon garlic powder. -Optional toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, sliced red onion, pickles -Leftover chicken can be stored for up to 4 days in an airtight container.</li>

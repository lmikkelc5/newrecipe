    <h1>Raspberry Buttercream Frosting</h1>
    <p>https://goodiegodmother.com/raspberry-buttercream-frosting/</p>
<p>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) **</p>
<p>1/2 lb salted butter, softened</p>
<p>1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p>7 cups powdered sugar</p>
<p>1. Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using</p>
<p>the back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze</p>
<p>out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This</p>
<p>makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</p>
<p>2. In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle</p>
<p>attachment, cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the</p>
<p>powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after</p>
<p>each addition.</p>
<p>3. Once you've added 5 cups of sugar, add the raspberry puree. Continue</p>
<p>adding the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</p>
<p>4. If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add</p>
<p>a little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</p>
<p>5. Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with</p>
<p>plastic wrap pressed along to top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting.</p>
<p>Re-whip before using.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>**Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.</p>

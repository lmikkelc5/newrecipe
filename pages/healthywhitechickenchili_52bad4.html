    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Add olive oil to a large dut by ch oven or large pot and place over medium high</li>
        <li>heat. Add onion and green chiles and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>2. Next stir in cumin, chili powder, coriander and dried oregano; allow the spices to</li>
        <li>cook for 30 seconds, then add in chicken broth, 1 can of drained chickpeas (about 1 1/2 cups chickpeas), uncooked chicken breast and salt and pepper. Simmer on medium low heat for 20-30 inutes.</li>
        <li>3. After 20 minutes, remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and shred with two</li>
        <li>forks. Next add in fresh lime juice and cilantro.</li>
        <li>4. Finally, add the remaining can of rinsed and drained chickpeas (1 1/2 cups</li>
        <li>chickpeas) and ½ cup water (or broth) to a blender. Blend until somewhat smooth, adding a little more water if necessary.</li>
        <li>5. Pour blended chickpeas into soup pot and then stir in the corn, lime juice and</li>
        <li>cilantro. Allow soup to cook and simmer for 5-10 more minutes. Serve with tortilla chips, an extra lime wedge and avocado if you’d like. Serves 4. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Recipe Notes</li>
        <li>Make this in your slow cooker: Making healthy white chicken chili in the slow cooker is EASY. Simply add all ingredients except the lime juice and cilantro to your slow cooker. I also recommend reducing the chicken broth in the recipe by 1 cup as your slow cooker will create condensation and additional liquid as the soup cooks. Cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-7 hours. Remove chicken and shred, then add back to the slow cooker and stir in lime juice and cilantro. Season to taste. That's it!</li>
        <li>To store: this white chicken chili will stay good in your fridge for about 1 week. Once your chili is completely cooled, just place it in an airtight container (or multiple, if you’d like to meal prep it) without the additional toppings and place it in the fridge. To reheat it, simply do so in the microwave with a microwave safe bowl, or feel free to reheat it on the stovetop. Add your toppings once you’re ready to serve!</li>
        <li>To freeze: follow the instructions above, but instead of placing the chili in the refrigerator just put it in your freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw the chili overnight and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave when you’re ready to eat.</li>

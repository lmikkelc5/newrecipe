    <h1>Pumpkin Bundt Cake</h1>
    <p>● 1 can (15 ounces, 425g) or 1-3/4 cups solid-packed pumpkin (I highly</p>
<p>recommend Libby's)</p>
<p>● 1 and 1/2 cups (311g) white granulated sugar ● 1/2 cup (113g) light brown sugar, packed ● 4 large eggs ● 1 cup (224g) vegetable oil ● 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ● 2 cups (250g) all-purpose white flour ● 2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
<p>● 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon ● 3/4 teaspoon ground cloves ● 1/2 teaspoon salt ● 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger ● 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg ● 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</p>
<p>Cream Cheese Frosting</p>
<p>● 1 package (8 ounces) full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature ● 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature ● 3 cups (342g) powdered sugar ● 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice ● 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ● 1/8 teaspoon salt ● Chopped (plain or candied) pecans, optional</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease and lightly flour a</p>
<p>10-inch bundt pan. Pop Set aside.</p>
<p>2. Place the canned pumpkin in a large bowl (if you have wet or fresh pumpkin,</p>
<p>make sure to drain off excess liquid) along with the white sugar, brown sugar,</p>
<p>eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat with a hand mixer until combined and well</p>
<p>blended.</p>
<p>3. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ground cloves,</p>
<p>salt, ground ginger, ground nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice. Whisk until</p>
<p>combined. Add the dry ingredients into the wet and beat until just combined.</p>
<p>Use a spatula to make sure all the ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>
<p>4. Pour mixture into a prepared Bundt pan and bake for 50-65 minutes or until a</p>
<p>toothpick when inserted into the center comes out clean or with moist cake</p>
<p>crumbs. The cake should spring back when lightly touched. Remove from the</p>
<p>oven and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before inverting the cake onto the</p>
<p>cooling rack to cool completely.</p>
<p>5. For the frosting: In a large bowl, beat ROOM-TEMPERATURE cream cheese</p>
<p>and butter until completely smooth. It's important the cream cheese and butter</p>
<p>are at the same temperature so you don't get lumpy cream cheese! Add</p>
<p>powdered sugar, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla and salt; beat until completely</p>
<p>smooth. Spread or pipe over the completely cooled cake. If desired, garnish</p>
<p>with chopped candied or plain pecans.</p>

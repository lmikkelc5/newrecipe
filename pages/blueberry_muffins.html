        <p>Muffin Batter:</p>
        <p>1 ½ cup all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>¾ cup sugar</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/3 cup vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 egg</p>
        <p>1/3 cup milk</p>
        <p>1 cup fresh blueberries</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400˚. Grease muffin tins or line with muffin liners. Combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.

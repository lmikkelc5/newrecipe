    <h1>Graham Cracker Crust</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>From</p>
        <p>1 and 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 full sheet graham crackers)</p>
        <p>5 Tablespoons (72g) unsalted butter, melted</p>
        <p>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and granulated sugar together with a rubber spatula in a medium bowl until combined. The mixture will be thick, coarse, and sandy. Press the mixture into the bottom of the dish or pan and slightly up the sides. This crust will fit into a 9 – 10 inch pan. Make sure it is tight and compact. Use the bottom of a flat measuring cup like I do in these photos. It helps! The crust will be thick.</li>
        <li>Variations: Use cinnamon, honey, or chocolate flavor graham crackers depending on your dessert recipe. I usually use honey flavor because it is the most mild. If I’m baking a chocolate treat, I like to switch things up and use the chocolate graham crackers. Try using brown sugar instead of granulated sugar for a hint of molasses flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>High Tea Lemon Cookies</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>(from English Trifle by Josi Kilpack)</p>
        <p>Cookies</p>
        <p>2 cups butter (room temperature)</p>
        <p>2/3 cup powdered sugar</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</p>
        <p>1 3/4 cups flour</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups cornstarch (this is not a typo)</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat butter until creamy. Add powdered sugar and mix until light and fluffy. Add lemon zest and vanilla. Beat well. Add flour and cornstarch and beat until well combined. Do NOT refrigerate.</p>
        <p>Roll by hand into 1-inch balls or use a well-packed scoop, placing cookies about an inch apart as they do not spread much while baking.</p>
        <p>Bake for 15 minutes on ungreased cookie sheets until bottom edges are light brown. Cool on wire racks before frosting with lemon glaze (below).</p>
        <p>Makes about 5 dozen small, delicate cookies.</p>

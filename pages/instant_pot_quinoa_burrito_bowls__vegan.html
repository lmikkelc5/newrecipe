    <h1>Instant Pot Quinoa Burrito Bowls (Vegan!)</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>These Instant Pot Vegan Quinoa Burrito Bowls are an easy and healthy make-ahead meal loaded with fiber and protein.</p>
        <p>PREP TIME 5 minutes</p>
        <p>COOK TIME 20 minutes</p>
        <p>TOTAL TIME 25 minutes</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 red onion, diced</p>
        <p>1 bell pepper, diced</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1 cup quinoa, rinsed well</p>
        <p>1 cup prepared salsa</p>
        <p>1 cup water</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups cooked black beans, or 1 (15 oz.) can, drained and rinsed</p>
        <p>Optional toppings: Avocado, guacamole, fresh cilantro, green onions, salsa, lime wedges, shredded lettuce</p>
        <p>Heat the oil in the bottom of the Instant Pot, using the "Saute" setting. Saute the onions and peppers until they start to soften, about 5 to 8 minutes, then add in cumin and salt and saute another minute. Turn off the Instant Pot for a moment.</p>
        <p>Add in the quinoa and water and stir well, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, to make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom. (This will trigger a burn error.) Add the salsa and beans on top without stirring again. Secure the lid and move the steam release valve to "Sealing."</p>
        <p>Press the Rice button (which cooks at LOW pressure for 12 minutes) or press the Manual or Pressure Cook button, and cook at high pressure for 1 minute. Let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes when the cooking cycle is complete, to let the quinoa finish cooking, without burning to the bottom of the pot. When the screen reads L0:15, move the steam release valve to Venting to release any remaining pressure.</p>
        <p>When the floating valve in the lid has dropped, it's safe to remove the lid. Fluff the quinoa with a fork, then serve warm with any toppings you love, such as avocado, diced onions, salsa, and shredded lettuce.</p>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You can quickly reheat on the stove top, or serve cold!</p>

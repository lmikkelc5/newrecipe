    <h1>Hard Boiled Eggs in Instant Pot – 5/5/5 method</h1>
    <p>amindfullmom.com  Instructions</p>
<p>1. Place 1 cup of COLD water in the inner pot of Instant Pot for a 6 quart</p>
<p>instant pot and 1.5 cups COLD water for an 8-quart Instant pot.</p>
<p>2. Add in egg or steam rack and carefully set as many eggs as desired on or in</p>
<p>the rack.</p>
<p>3. Place lid on the pressure cooker and set cook time for 5 minutes on high</p>
<p>pressure.</p>
<p>4. Once cook time has elapsed, let the pressure release for 5 minutes. Then</p>
<p>do a quick release and carefully remove eggs from Instant Pot and place in</p>
<p>ice water bath.</p>
<p>5. Let eggs sit in water bath for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>6. Remove eggs from the water bath.</p>
<p>7. Store in the fridge for up to 7 days unpeeled or peel and use within 3 days.</p>
<p>Equipment Needed</p>
<p>● Electric Pressure Cooker (6 or 8 quart)</p>
<p>● Egg Rack</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>● You can use as few as 1 egg and up to 16 eggs in a 6-quart pressure</p>
<p>cooker.</p>
<p>● I find it is best to peel eggs right from the water bath, the shell comes off</p>
<p>beautifully every single time.</p>
<p>● To help prevent your eggs from cracking during cooking, let your eggs come</p>
<p>to room temperature before pressure cooking.</p>
<p>● Be sure to use cold water, warm water or hot water will change the cooking</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>● If you live at high altitude, be sure to use Instant Pot Altitude Adjustments.</p>

    <h1>Inside Out Ravioli Casserole</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>1 lb. Lean hamburger</p>
        <p>1 medium onion chopped</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic minced</p>
        <p>10 oz pkg frozen chopped spinach</p>
        <p>1 lb can spaghetti sauce with mushrooms</p>
        <p>8 oz can tomato sauce</p>
        <p>6 oz can tomato paste</p>
        <p>½ tsp salt</p>
        <p>7 oz pkg shell macaroni</p>
        <p>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</p>
        <p>½ cup soft bread crumbs</p>
        <p>2 well beaten eggs</p>
        <p>1/4 cup salad oil</p>
        <p>Brown beef, onion and garlic. Cook spinach as package directs. Drain, reserving liquid. Add water to this to make 1 cup liquid. Combine spinach liquid, spaghetti sauce, tomato sauce, tomato paste and salt with beef mixture and simmer. Cook macaroni as usual. Drain and combine with spinach, cheese, crumbs, eggs and oil. Spread in 13x 9 pan. Top with meat mixture. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Let stand a few minutes before serving.</p>
        <p>The only thing I might do differently is not put quite so much oil in. I'm glad you reminded me of this...I haven't made it for a long time!</p>

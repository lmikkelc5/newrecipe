    <h1>Herb Roasted Pork</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>1 tsp rubbed sage</p>
        <p>½ tsp salt</p>
        <p>¼ tsp pepper</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, crushed</p>
        <p>1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin</p>
        <p>½ c sugar</p>
        <p>1 TBSP cornstarch</p>
        <p>¼ c vinegar</p>
        <p>¼ c water</p>
        <p>2 TBSP soy sauce</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 325˚</p>
        <p>In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Rub thoroughly all over pork.  Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.</p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven approximately 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145˚, depending on your desired doneness.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan.  Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly.  Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last ½ hour of cooking.  Pour remaining glaze over roast and serve.</p>
        <p>Note:  Sear the roast after rubbing with spices and before putting in the oven.  Other pork recipes call for an internal temp of 180.  I think I like 160.</p>

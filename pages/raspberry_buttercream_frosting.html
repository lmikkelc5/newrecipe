    <h1>Raspberry Buttercream Frosting</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) **</p>
        <p>1/2 lb salted butter, softened</p>
        <p>1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened</p>
        <p>7 cups powdered sugar</p>
        <p>Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using the back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</p>
        <p>In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after each addition.</p>
        <p>Once you've added 5 cups of sugar, add the raspberry puree. Continue adding the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</p>
        <p>If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add a little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</p>
        <p>Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with plastic wrap pressed along to top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting. Re-whip before using.</p>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p>**Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.</p>

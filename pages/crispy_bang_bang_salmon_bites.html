    <h1>Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the Salmon Bites:</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets (skin removed, cut into bite-sized pieces)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)</li>
        <li>For the Bang Bang Sauce:</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce (adjust for preferred heat level)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice (freshly squeezed)</li>
        <li>Optional Garnish:</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>Green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Prep the Salmon</li>
        <li>Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy texture. Remove any skin and cut the salmon into 1-inch bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
        <li>Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make the Bang Bang Sauce</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce, sriracha, honey, and lime juice until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the sauce—add more sriracha for heat or honey for sweetness. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Cook the Salmon</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a small amount of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add the salmon pieces in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if needed.</li>
        <li>Sear the salmon for 2-3 minutes per side, gently turning to brown all sides. Cook until the salmon is golden and crispy on the outside, tender and flaky inside.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked salmon bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Coat in Bang Bang Sauce</li>
        <li>Drizzle it: Place the salmon bites on a serving platter and drizzle the sauce over them.</li>
        <li>Toss it: Add the salmon bites to a bowl, pour the sauce over, and gently toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</li>
        <li>Garnish the salmon bites with chopped parsley, green onions, or sesame seeds for extra flavor and color.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately to enjoy their crispy texture and vibrant flavors.</li>
        <li>Tips for Achieving Maximum Crispiness</li>
        <li>The key to perfectly Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites lies in a few simple but essential techniques. Follow these tips to ensure your salmon bites are irresistibly crunchy every time.</li>
        <li>Pat the Salmon Dry</li>
        <li>Removing excess moisture is crucial for crispiness. Use a paper towel to thoroughly pat the salmon pieces dry before seasoning. This prevents steaming during cooking and ensures a golden, crispy exterior.</li>
        <li>Use Cornstarch or Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>For an extra crispy coating, lightly dust the salmon pieces with cornstarch before cooking. Alternatively, coat them in panko breadcrumbs for added crunch. Panko’s airy texture creates a delightful crispness that regular breadcrumbs can’t achieve. For more tips on breading techniques, explore this guide.</li>
        <li>Avoid Overcrowding the Pan or Air Fryer</li>
        <li>Overcrowding lowers the cooking temperature, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy salmon. Cook in small batches, leaving enough space between pieces to allow air circulation or consistent heat distribution.</li>
        <li>Maintain the Right Oil Temperature</li>
        <li>Whether pan-searing or air-frying, ensure the oil is hot enough (around 375°F/190°C) before adding the salmon. Proper oil temperature prevents sticking and sogginess while achieving a crisp outer layer. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the salmon will absorb it, losing its crunch.</li>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Herb Roasted Pork</li>
        <li>1 tsp rubbed sage ½ tsp salt ¼ tsp pepper 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin ½ c sugar 1 TBSP cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ c vinegar ¼ c water 2 TBSP soy sauce  Preheat oven to 325˚  In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Rub thoroughly all over pork.  Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.  Bake in the preheated oven approximately 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145˚, depending on your desired doneness.  Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly.  Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last ½ hour of cooking.  Pour remaining glaze over roast and serve.  Note:  Sear the roast after rubbing with spices and before putting in the oven.  Other pork recipes call for an internal temp of 180.  I think I like 160.</li>

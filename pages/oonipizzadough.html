        <h1>Classic Pizza Dough (Ooni)</h1>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups + 1 tbsp lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 heaping teaspoon (3 1/2g) active dry yeast or 1 teaspoon(2.7g) instant dry yeast or 1 tbsp (8 1/2g) fresh yeast</li>
                <li>5 1/4 cups (613g "00" flour), plus extra for dusting</li>
                <li>3 tsp (18g) sea salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Process</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>In a mixer combine ingredients and turn on low for 5 to 10 min or until its firm and stretchy</li>
                <li>Cover the dough and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours or until doubled</li>                
                <li>If mixing by hand mix with a wooden spoon and then knead for about 10 min, then set to rise</li>
                <li>When dough is ready, divide into 3(16  inch pizzas) or 4(12 inch pizzas) equal pieces. Place each ball into in seperate bowls to rise for another 30-60 min</li>
                <li>When they are ready, stretch them out and put your toppings on</li>
                </ol>    
            <p>These are much denser pizzas. Come out really good on the ooni and stick less then normal pizza dough. They end up almost like flatbread.</p>

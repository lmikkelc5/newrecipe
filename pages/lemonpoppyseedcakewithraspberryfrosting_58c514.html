<p>Raspberry Frosting</p>
<p>https://goodiegodmother.com/raspberry-buttercream-frosting/</p>
<p>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) ** 1/2 lb salted butter, softened 1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened 7 cups powdered sugar **Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.  Instructions</p>
<p>1. Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using the</p>
<p>back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</p>
<p>2. In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,</p>
<p>cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after each addition.</p>
<p>3. Once you've added 5 cups of sugar, add the raspberry puree. Continue adding</p>
<p>the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</p>
<p>4. If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add a</p>
<p>little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</p>
<p>5. Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with plastic</p>
<p>wrap pressed along to the top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting. Re-whip before using.</p>

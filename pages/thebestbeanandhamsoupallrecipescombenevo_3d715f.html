    <h1>The Best Bean and Ham Soup (allrecipes.com Benevolent Empress)</h1>
    <p>I wrote this recipe and the directions printed are not as I wrote them. Here they are:</p>
<p>Remove and discard seasoning packet, if any, from beans. Place beans in large stockpot. Cover with water to 2 inches over beans and soak overnight. Drain the</p>
<p>soaking water from the beans. Cover beans with fresh water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Drain again, discarding water. Remove all visible fat from ham bone. Combine beans, ham bone, ham, onion, celery, carrots, tomatoes, V8, Worcestershire, mustard, chili powder, bay leaves, pepper, parsley,</p>
<p>lemon juice, and vegetable stock in stockpot. Add chicken stock to cover beans. Bring</p>
<p>to boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 8 hours. Add remaining</p>
<p>chicken stock to the pot throughout the day as needed to keep liquid level up. After about 8 hours, remove the ham bone, and add salt as needed. Continue simmering</p>
<p>another 2 hours, or until beans are tender. Remove bay leaves before serving.</p>

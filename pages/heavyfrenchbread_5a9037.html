    <h1>Heavy French Bread</h1>
    <p>(from Sheryl Demars and Jenna Lake)</p>
<p>2 ½ c warm water 2 TBSP yeast 2 TBSP sugar 2 TBSP oil 2 tsp salt 6 c flour (more or less)  In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar.  Let froth.  Add oil, salt, and flour.  Mix well until incorporated and knead until soft.  Dust the counter with flour and place the dough on flour.  Cover and let rise until double, about one hour.  Punch down and let rise for one minute.  Divide dough in two equal parts on floured counter.  Shape into two loaves.  Place on greased and corn mealed jelly roll pan.  Both loaves will fit length-wise on one pan.  (If you desire a shiny crust, brush loaves with slightly beaten</p>
<p>egg.)  With a sharp knife, make four diagonal slashes in each loaf.  Let rise for 30 minutes and place in cold oven.  Turn oven to 400˚ and bake for 35 minutes, until very golden brown.  Let rest at least ten minutes before cutting.  I like to leave the crust without egg, as I love lots of hard, flour-dusted crust.  This is a very meaty bread.  I like to rip it instead of cut it as it reminds me of the breads (pan al horno) of my mission in Argentina.  T’otal time start to finish:  approx. 2 hrs 15 min</p>

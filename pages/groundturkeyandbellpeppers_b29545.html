    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey, preferably ground turkey thighs 1 teaspoon chili powder (or to taste) 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or cilantro or substitute 2 tablespoons pesto</li>
        <li>1. Saut√© the onions, bell pepper, and garlic:</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Add</li>
        <li>the chopped onions and bell pepper and cook until onions and peppers are softened, a couple minutes.</li>

        <li>2. Add ground turkey, salt, and chipotle chili powder</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables to the edge of one side of the pan and position that</li>
        <li>side of the pan so that it is off the burner, away from the heat. The empty part of the pan should be right over the burner.</li>
        <li>Add one or two more tablespoons of oil to coat the empty part of the pan.</li>
        <li>Put crumpled chunks of ground turkey in the pan, sprinkle with salt and chipotle or chili powder.</li>
        <li>3. Brown the turkey, then stir in the peppers and onions</li>
        <li>Cook the turkey without stirring until it is browned on one side, then turn</li>
        <li>the pieces over to brown the other side.</li>
        <li>4. Once the turkey is just cooked through, stir in the onions and peppers, and sprinkle with more salt and chili powder to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in fresh chopped parsley or cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve alone, or with steamed rice or noodles.</li>

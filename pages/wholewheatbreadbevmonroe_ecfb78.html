    <h1>Whole Wheat Bread - Bev Monroe</h1>
    <p>6 c. warm water</p>
<p>2 T. yeast ¼ c. oil ¼ c. lecithin ½ c. honey ½ c. gluten powder 1 T. salt 2 T. Dough conditioner 10 c. Whole wheat flour  Pour the warm water (about 105°) into mixer.  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water. Using a 1 cup measuring cup, pour ¼ cup oil into the measuring cup first; swirl oil and coat the inside of measure cup.  Pour ½ cup honey into the cup on top of the oil—both will reach ¾ cup line.  Pour both into the mixer (honey will not stick to cup).  Next measure ¼ cup lecithin in the same measuring cup so it will also slide out with less sticking.  Add the remaining ingredients listed into the mixer and turn mixer on low and mix.  The mixture will take a few minutes to look uniform in texture.  Once this occurs, where everything is well blended together, start adding additional flour until the dough is one mass and pulls away from the sides and bottom of mixer (2-4 cups or more of flour depending on your flour).  Now this is the secret of really good bread—set the timer and knead on low speed for at least 10 minutes.  Immediately after kneading, remove dough from mixer, divide into 6 portions.  Spray loaf pans with nonstick spray; shape dough into loaves and put into bread loaf pans.  Let rise until doubled in size—about 40 minutes.  Bake 25 minutes at 350°.  Do not overbake as it dries out bread.  Freeze bread that will not be eaten in one day to keep it moist and fresh.</p>

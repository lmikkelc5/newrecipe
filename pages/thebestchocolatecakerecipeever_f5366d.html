    <p>https://addapinch.com/the-best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever/</p>
<p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>2 cups sugar</p>
<p>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
<p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1 teaspoon espresso powder homemade or store-bought</p>
<p>1 cup milk or buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk</p>
<p>1/2 cup vegetable oil or canola oil, or melted coconut oil</p>
<p>2 large eggs</p>
<p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<p>1 cup boiling water</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.  For the Chocolate Cake</p>
<p>1. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder</p>
<p>to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</p>
<p>2. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on</p>
<p>medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.</p>
<p>3. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for</p>
<p>30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.</p>
<p>4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the</p>
<p>pan and cool completely.</p>
<p>5. Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting below.</p>
<p>Notes: The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted! Freezer Friendly- Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight with wrapping intact. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost. High Altitude- If you live at a high altitude, adjust the recipe based upon the altitude for your area.</p>

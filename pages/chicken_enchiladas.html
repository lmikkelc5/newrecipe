        <p>Chicken Gnocchi Soup</p>
        <p>HOW TO MAKE THE SOUP</p>
        <p>There are three parts to making this: the chicken, the gnocchi, and the base of the soup!</p>
        <p>First up, THE CHICKEN:</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>italian seasoning</li>
        <li>lemon pepper</li>
        <li>smoked paprika</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add the chicken breast, olive oil, Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix to marinade evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat an oiled skillet or pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook on each side until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes each side, depending how thick the breast is. Then drop the heat to low and allow the chicken to cook through to the center or the temperature registers 165°F. Remove the chicken from the pan and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Chop the chicken into cubes now and set aside. If you prefer shredded chicken in the soup instead of cubed, feel free to shred it.</li>
        <li>SOUP BASE</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>carrots</li>
        <li>yellow onion</li>
        <li>celery</li>
        <li>chicken broth</li>
        <li>half and half</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>basil</li>
        <li>parmesan</li>
        <li>Start by sautéing the garlic, chopped carrots, diced onion, and chopped celery in a little bit of butter and oil in a large pot. Cook just until the onions are softened. Then add the chicken broth. Combine the half and half with flour by whisking together in a bowl and then add to the pot. The flour acts as a thickener for the soup just to make it a bit more creamy. Mix all together and then add the following spices to season it up: black pepper, Italian seasoning, sweet paprika, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cover and let it simmer for 30 minutes just for flavors to meld in nicely.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, take off the lid and add parmesan, parsley, red pepper flakes, basil, and the gnocchi. Mix together and let the gnocchi cook for about 9 minutes or until soft. The last step is to toss some spinach in there, taste the soup, adjust any seasoning, and take off the heat to enjoy!</li>
        <li>To make this even lighter, you can swap the half and half with milk or to make it even more creamy, you can use heavy cream!</li>

    <h1>Grandma Lambert’s Molasses Cookies</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>This recipe is from my great-grandma Marjorie Linton Lambert and these have always been some of my favorite cookies! She was an amazing homemaker and taught my grandma Lambert how to do a lot of the things that were considered essential for running a home (knitting, crocheting and sewing). My grandma has taught me and all of my sisters how to do many of those things and it just adds to my great-grandma Lambert’s legacy. These cookies taste like fall with some of those spices that we love at this time of year and they’re so easy to make. Enjoy!</p>

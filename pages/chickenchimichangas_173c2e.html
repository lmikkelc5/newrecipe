    <h1>Chicken Chimichangas</h1>
    <p>1 whole chicken or 4 large chicken breasts, cooked and shredded 1 c. salsa (I use lots more than that) 1 tsp. garlic salt 1 tsp. oregano 1 TBSP cumin Cheese Tortilla shells  Place chicken, salsa, and spices in pan and heat through.  Put chicken mixture and grated cheese in tortilla shell and roll.  Place in 9X13 pan, seam side down.  Baste lightly with butter to brown shells, or sprinkle with cheese.  Bake at 400Â° for 13 min. Serve with sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, salsa, guacamole, etc.  Note:  I like to add rice and black beans to the meat mixture.  Also works well with shredded beef.</p>

        <li>Saut√© the onions, bell pepper, and garlic:</li>

        <li>3. Brown the turkey, then stir in the peppers and onions</li>
        <li>Cook the turkey without stirring until it is browned on one side, then turn the pieces over to brown the other side.</li>
        <li>4. Once the turkey is just cooked through, stir in the onions and peppers, and sprinkle with more salt and chili powder to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in fresh chopped parsley or cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve alone, or with steamed rice or noodles.</li>

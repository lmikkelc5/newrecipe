        <p>I decided to make truffles for the first time this week - Almond Joy flavor. And let me just say:  Amazing. If I were to give you my honest opinion about them, I'd say that they might just taste even better than Almond Joys. *Gasp* If you like Almond Joys, you need to make these. Pronto.</p>
        <p>Almond Joy Truffles</p>
        <p>Makes about 3 dozen</p>
        <p>·	4 C coconut flakes</p>
        <p>·	3 & 3/4 C powdered sugar</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1.  Line a baking sheet with wax paper.</li>
        <li>2.  In a large bowl, mix the coconut, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and almonds.</li>
        <li>3.  Shape into 1 inch balls and place on wax paper. {It's ok if they aren't perfectly round, you'll be able to perfect them later on.}</li>
        <li>4.  Refrigerate for at least one hour until firm.</li>
        <li>6.  Dip the coconut balls into the chocolate and place on wax paper. {I used two spoons to maneuver the dipping to still make the truffles look decent.}</li>
        <li>7.  Let the truffles sit until hard, 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>9. Place in a small baggie and cut a small hole in one corner.</li>
        <li>10.  Carefully drizzle white chocolate over truffles.</li>
        <li>11.  Let sit until hard, 5-10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

<p>HOW TO MAKE THE SOUP  There are three parts to making this: the chicken, the gnocchi, and the base of the soup!  First up, THE CHICKEN:  This is where we get to incorporate a lot of flavor into this soup with some very well-seasoned juicy chicken. We will be using chicken breast and marinating it with the following ingredients:  olive oil italian seasoning lemon pepper smoked paprika garlic powder salt black pepper In a bowl, add the chicken breast, olive oil, Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix to marinade evenly.  Heat an oiled skillet or pan over medium-high heat.  Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook on each side until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes each side, depending how thick the breast is. Then drop the heat to low and allow the chicken to cook through to the center or the temperature registers 165°F. Remove the chicken from the pan and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Chop the chicken into cubes now and set aside. If you prefer shredded chicken in the soup instead of cubed, feel free to shred it. SOUP BASE butter olive oil garlic</p>
<p>carrots yellow onion celery chicken broth half and half flour spices parsley basil parmesan Start by sautéing the garlic, chopped carrots, diced onion, and chopped celery in a little bit of butter and oil in a large pot. Cook just until the onions are softened. Then add the chicken broth. Combine the half and half with flour by whisking together in a bowl and then add to the pot. The flour acts as a thickener for the soup just to make it a bit more creamy. Mix all together and then add the following spices to season it up: black pepper, Italian seasoning, sweet paprika, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cover and let it simmer for 30 minutes just for flavors to meld in nicely.  After 30 minutes, take off the lid and add parmesan, parsley, red pepper flakes, basil, and the gnocchi. Mix together and let the gnocchi cook for about 9 minutes or until soft. The last step is to toss some spinach in there, taste the soup, adjust any seasoning, and take off the heat to enjoy! To make this even lighter, you can swap the half and half with milk or to make it even more creamy, you can use heavy cream!  https://moribyan.com/chicken-gnocchi-soup/</p>

<p>Crispy Baked Fish Tacos</p>
<p>https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fish-tacos/#tasty-recipes-59652</p>
<p>● 1 cup panko breadcrumbs</p>
<p>● 2 teaspoons chili powder*</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>● 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper</p>
<p>● 1 egg, whisked</p>
<p>● 1 1/2 pounds firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p>1. To Make The Fish: Heat oven to 375°F.  Spread the panko out in an even layer</p>
<p>on a medium baking sheet*.  Bake for 5-7 minutes, giving the pan a gentle shake</p>
<p>halfway through, until the panko is toasted and golden brown.  (Keep a close eye</p>
<p>on the panko so that it does not burn.) Transfer the panko to a medium bowl, and</p>
<p>dust off the baking sheet for future use.</p>
<p>2. Add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper to the bowl with the panko,</p>
<p>then whisk the mixture until combined.</p>
<p>3. Now, set up an assembly line with the (1) fish, (2) whisked egg, (3) panko mixture</p>
<p>and (4) parchment-covered baking sheet.  Using your right hand, dip a piece of</p>
<p>fish in the egg so that it is coated on all sides.  Then, using your left hand,</p>
<p>transfer the fish to the panko mixture and gently press it on so that the fish is</p>
<p>coated on all sides.  Using your left hand, transfer the fish to the baking sheet.</p>
<p>Then repeat the process with the remaining fish.</p>
<p>4. Bake the fish for 10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and opaque and flakes</p>
<p>easily with a fork.  (Internal temperature should be 145°F*.)  Transfer baking</p>
<p>sheet to a wire rack, then use a fork to roughly flake the fish into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>*Crispy Panko: To make the panko even crispier, feel free to toss it with 1 tablespoon of</p>
<p>oil before toasting it in the oven.  I recommend letting the panko toast in the oven until it</p>
<p>reaches a pretty deep golden brown for maximum crispiness.</p>
<p>*Fish Internal Temperature: The FDA says that the safe internal temperature for cooked</p>
<p>fish is 145°F.  I usually pull mine out of the oven around 135-140°F, since the</p>
<p>temperature will continue to rise a few degrees more while the fish rests.</p>
<p>Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites</p>
<p>https://grammyrecipes.com/crispy-bang-bang-salmon-bites/</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy texture. Remove</li>
        <li>any skin and cut the salmon into 1-inch bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>2. Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with</li>
        <li>garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
        <li>3. Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make the Bang Bang Sauce</li>
        <li>1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce,</li>
        <li>sriracha, honey, and lime juice until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>2. Taste and adjust the sauce—add more sriracha for heat or honey for sweetness.</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Cook the Salmon</li>
        <li>1. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a small amount of</li>
        <li>olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>2. Once the oil is hot, add the salmon pieces in a single layer, making sure not to</li>
        <li>overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if needed.</li>
        <li>3. Sear the salmon for 2-3 minutes per side, gently turning to brown all sides. Cook</li>
        <li>until the salmon is golden and crispy on the outside, tender and flaky inside.</li>
        <li>4. Transfer cooked salmon bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess</li>
        <li>oil.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Coat in Bang Bang Sauce  Drizzle it: Place the salmon bites on a serving platter and drizzle the sauce over them. Toss it: Add the salmon bites to a bowl, pour the sauce over, and gently toss to coat.  Step 5: Garnish and Serve</li>
        <li>1. Garnish the salmon bites with chopped parsley, green onions, or sesame seeds</li>
        <li>for extra flavor and color.</li>
        <li>2. Serve immediately to enjoy their crispy texture and vibrant flavors.</li>
        <li>Tips for Achieving Maximum Crispiness</li>
        <li>The key to perfectly Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites lies in a few simple but essential</li>
        <li>techniques. Follow these tips to ensure your salmon bites are irresistibly crunchy every</li>
        <li>time.</li>
        <li>Pat the Salmon Dry</li>
        <li>Removing excess moisture is crucial for crispiness. Use a paper towel to thoroughly pat</li>
        <li>the salmon pieces dry before seasoning. This prevents steaming during cooking and</li>
        <li>ensures a golden, crispy exterior.</li>
        <li>Use Cornstarch or Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>For an extra crispy coating, lightly dust the salmon pieces with cornstarch before</li>
        <li>cooking. Alternatively, coat them in panko breadcrumbs for added crunch. Panko’s airy</li>
        <li>texture creates a delightful crispness that regular breadcrumbs can’t achieve. For more</li>
        <li>tips on breading techniques, explore this guide.</li>
        <li>Avoid Overcrowding the Pan or Air Fryer</li>
        <li>Overcrowding lowers the cooking temperature, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy</li>
        <li>salmon. Cook in small batches, leaving enough space between pieces to allow air</li>
        <li>circulation or consistent heat distribution.</li>
        <li>Maintain the Right Oil Temperature</li>
        <li>Whether pan-searing or air-frying, ensure the oil is hot enough (around 375°F/190°C)</li>
        <li>before adding the salmon. Proper oil temperature prevents sticking and sogginess while</li>
        <li>achieving a crisp outer layer. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the salmon will absorb it, losing</li>
        <li>its crunch.</li>

        <li>3. Pour the batter ON TOP OF the Butter. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>4. Spoon on the peaches. Again, DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>5. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes to 1 hour. The cobbler is done when it’s</li>
        <li>edges are deeply golden and a toothpick inserted in the cake-part comes out</li>
        <li>clean.</li>
        <li>You can use a Dutch oven ranging in size from eight to 12 inches; just adjust the</li>
        <li>cooking time accordingly. A smaller Dutch oven will need longer, while a larger Dutch</li>
        <li>oven may finish cooking more quickly.</li>
        <li>Over the campfire</li>
        <li>1. Lightly butter the inside of a camp dutch oven.</li>
        <li>2. Prepare the peach filling as directed in the oven method.</li>
        <li>3. In a separate bowl, stir together the topping ingredients as directed. After adding</li>
        <li>the milk, stir in the melted butter. Spoon the fruit into the bottom of the buttered</li>
        <li>dutch oven, along with any juices that have collected. Slowly pour the batter over</li>
        <li>the top of the peaches. DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>4. Cover the dutch oven with its lid. Place 15 hot charcoal briquettes together (they</li>
        <li>will be covered with ash) and set the dutch oven over them. Using tongs, place</li>
        <li>the remaining 30 briquettes on the dutch oven lid. (This number and placement is</li>
        <li>necessary for the dutch oven to reach 350 degrees F.) (I build a platform out of</li>
        <li>burning wood and put the dutch oven on them and throw some coals on top. No</li>
        <li>need to be all fancy)</li>
        <li>5. Rotate after 10 min</li>
        <li>6. Check after 20 min, its done when the topping is golden brown and the juices are</li>
        <li>bubbling, this should take about 35 to 45 min</li>
        <li>Order is reversed to stop the cake part from burning, this means that the cake will rise</li>
        <li>more as the cake isn't weighed down by the fruit.</li>

        <li>Fried Chicken</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour paprika</li>
        <li>Poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper (adjust to taste) 2 eggs beaten 1 1/2 cups canned milk 1 quart vegetable oil for frying (350) Boneless Chicken breasts (approx 3 Ibs.) Directions</li>
        <li>1. In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black</li>
        <li>pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, eggs and canned milk. You may need to thin with additional milk if the batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>2. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each</li>
        <li>piece of chicken with a little milk or water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more. I really work the flour into the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>3. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until</li>
        <li>well-browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>4. I put mine covered in the oven for about 15 minutes. More to keep warm while</li>

        <li>Grilled Chicken Sandwiches</li>
        <li>https://www.spendwithpennies.com/grilled-chicken-sandwich/    Ingredients</li>
        <li>● 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts about 4 small breasts ● 4 hamburger buns or brioche rolls ● ¼ cup honey mustard sauce * or mayonnaise ● toppings as desired (see notes)</li>
        <li>Marinade</li>
        <li>● 3 tablespoons vegetable oil ● 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar ● 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard ● 1 tablespoon brown sugar ● 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>● ½ teaspoon salt ● ½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board and lightly cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Use the flat side of a meat mallet to pound chicken breasts to ½-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl or freezer bag. Add chicken and toss</li>
        <li>well to combine. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat (375°F). 4. Remove the chicken from the marinade allowing excess to drip off and discard</li>
        <li>the marinade.</li>
        <li>5. Add the chicken to the grill and cook for 5-6 minutes per side or until no pink</li>
        <li>remains and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>
        <li>6. While chicken is cooking, brush the cut side of the buns with olive oil and place</li>
        <li>face down on the grill. Cook until lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>7. Spread each bun with honey mustard and add lettuce, tomatoes and onions if</li>
        <li>desired. Top with chicken and serve.</li>
        <li>Notes -If your chicken breasts are larger, they can be cut to make 4 portions. -Do not overcook the chicken, it is pounded to cook evenly and only needs about 10-12 minutes. -Chicken breasts can be replaced with boneless skinless chicken thighs. -Homemade Honey Mustard: Combine ⅓ cup mayonnaise, 1 ½ tablespoons yellow mustard, 1 ½ tablespoons honey &  ½ teaspoon garlic powder. -Optional toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, sliced red onion, pickles -Leftover chicken can be stored for up to 4 days in an airtight container.</li>
        <li>Ground Turkey and Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/moms_ground_turkey_and_peppers/</li>
        <li>Herb Roasted Pork</li>
        <li>1 tsp rubbed sage ½ tsp salt ¼ tsp pepper 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin ½ c sugar 1 TBSP cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ c vinegar ¼ c water 2 TBSP soy sauce  Preheat oven to 325˚  In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Rub thoroughly all over pork.  Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.  Bake in the preheated oven approximately 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145˚, depending on your desired doneness.  Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly.  Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last ½ hour of cooking.  Pour remaining glaze over roast and serve.  Note:  Sear the roast after rubbing with spices and before putting in the oven.  Other pork recipes call for an internal temp of 180.  I think I like 160.</li>

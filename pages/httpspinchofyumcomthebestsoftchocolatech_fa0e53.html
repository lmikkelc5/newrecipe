    <h1>https://pinchofyum.com/the-best-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies</h1>
    <p>½ cup brown sugar 1 cup sugar 2 sticks melted salted butter 2 eggs 2 tsp vanilla 3 cups of flour 1 tsp baking soda ½ tsp salt 1 ½  cups Chocolate chips</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 60 seconds to</p>
<p>just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid</p>
<p>form.</p>
<p>2. Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until</p>
<p>creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated –</p>
<p>10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).</p>
<p>3. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to</p>
<p>press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is</p>
<p>easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the</p>
<p>chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.</p>
<p>4. Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place</p>
<p>on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and</p>
<p>just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is</p>
<p>probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for</p>
<p>keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet</p>
<p>(see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.</p>
<p>5. Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or</p>
<p>five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these</p>
<p>dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay</p>
<p>soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide soup evenly among 4 serving bowls, garnishing each with cream and parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Note: This is the original recipe.  I found when I made it that the thyme flavor was too strong.  I used 1 ½ times the recipe to make it for my family and I only use ½-3/4 tsp thyme for that amount.  I also usually skip the step that calls for pureeing the soup.</li>
    </ol>

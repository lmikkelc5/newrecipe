    <h1>Pumpkin Bundt Cake</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>1 can (15 ounces, 425g) or 1-3/4 cups solid-packed pumpkin (I highly recommend Libby's)</p>
        <p>1 and 1/2 cups (311g) white granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 cup (113g) light brown sugar, packed</p>
        <p>4 large eggs</p>
        <p>1 cup (224g) vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>2 cups (250g) all-purpose white flour</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons baking soda</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon ground cloves</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</p>
        <p>Cream Cheese Frosting</p>
        <p>1 package (8 ounces) full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature</p>
        <p>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
        <p>3 cups (342g) powdered sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>Chopped (plain or candied) pecans, optional</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease and lightly flour a 10-inch bundt pan. Pop Set aside.</p>
        <p>Place the canned pumpkin in a large bowl (if you have wet or fresh pumpkin, make sure to drain off excess liquid) along with the white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat with a hand mixer until combined and well blended.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pour mixture into a prepared Bundt pan and bake for 50-65 minutes or until a toothpick when inserted into the center comes out clean or with moist cake crumbs. The cake should spring back when lightly touched. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before inverting the cake onto the cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For the frosting: In a large bowl, beat ROOM-TEMPERATURE cream cheese and butter until completely smooth. It's important the cream cheese and butter are at the same temperature so you don't get lumpy cream cheese! Add powdered sugar, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla and salt; beat until completely smooth. Spread or pipe over the completely cooled cake. If desired, garnish with chopped candied or plain pecans.</li>
    </ul>

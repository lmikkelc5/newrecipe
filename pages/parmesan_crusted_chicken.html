    <h1>Parmesan Crusted Chicken</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>Servings: 4</p>
        <p>Total Time: 30 Minutes</p>
        <p>Breading:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup all purpose flour</p>
        <p>2 eggs</p>
        <p>2/3 cup seasoned Italian bread crumbs (I use Progresso)</p>
        <p>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme, parsley, chives or rosemary</p>
        <p>Chicken:</p>
        <p>3-4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1-1/2 pounds), pounded 1/4' -thick*</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>Lemon wedges, for serving</p>
        <p>Set up three large shallow bowls in an assembly line. Put the flour in the first bowl; beat the eggs in the second bowl; and mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and chopped fresh herbs in the third bowl. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Dredge the first chicken breast in the flour and shake off the excess until just a light coating remains.</p>
        <p>Next, dip the chicken in the egg mixture and turn to coat evenly, letting any excess egg drip off. Finally, dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture, turning a few times to coat well. Set breaded chicken on a plate and repeat until all of the chicken breasts are breaded.</p>
        <p>Heat both oils in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the first side is golden brown. Flip and continue cooking until done, 2-3 minutes longer. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.</p>
        <p>*If chicken breasts are large (8 or more ounces), you can cut them in half once they are pounded out.</p>

    <h1>Pasta Fagioli with Spinach</h1>
    <p>Mary Lambert</p>
<p>Adopted by Rebecca Funk</p>
<p>3 cans (15 to 19 oz.) Great Northern Beans (or other white beans), rinsed and drained 1lb sweet Italian sausage 1 Tbsp olive oil 2 medium onions, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 14-oz cans diced tomatoes with juice 28 oz chicken broth ½ tsp salt 1 rounded cup of any tiny pasta you can find 5 oz.  frozen chopped spinach grated parmesan cheese  Heat a large pot (at least 6 quarts) over medium high heat until hot.  Remove sausage from casings and add to pot, breaking into pieces with a spoon, until browned.  Remove from pot with slotted spoon and set aside.  Reduce heat to medium.  In drippings and olive oil, cook onions until tender and golden, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, cook 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with their juice.  Add chicken broth, salt, beans and two cups of water.  Return sausage to pot.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes.  Just before serving add spinach and pasta.  Simmer until pasta is tender.  Garnish with cheese.  Makes about 16 cups.  Note:  This recipe makes kind of a lot. When I make it for our family, I don’t put pasta in all of it, because the leftovers get mushy.  I usually freeze half of the soup with</p>
<p>everything in it but the pasta and add it fresh right before eating.  It’s also a great soup because every ingredient is either frozen or a pantry item, so you can always have it on hand for when you’re too lazy to go to the store.</p>

    <h1>Oven Roasted Asparagus</h1>
    <p>Original recipe makes 4 servings</p>
<p>1 bunch thin asparagus spears, trimmed</p>
<p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>1 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</p>
<p>1 clove garlic, minced (optional) (or garlic powder sprinkled on) 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (I donâ€™t use anywhere near that much salt and pepper.  I just sprinkle on) 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)  1.   Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2.  Place the asparagus into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss to coat the spears, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange the asparagus onto a baking sheet in a single layer. 3.  Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes depending on thickness. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving.  Cook's Note To remove woody ends, grab stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.</p>

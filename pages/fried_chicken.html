    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>3 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1 1/2 tablespoons garlic salt</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>paprika</p>
        <p>Poultry seasoning</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper (adjust to taste)</p>
        <p>2 eggs beaten</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups canned milk</p>
        <p>1 quart vegetable oil for frying (350)</p>
        <p>Boneless Chicken breasts (approx 3 Ibs.)</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, Â¼ teaspoon pepper, eggs and canned milk. You may need to thin with additional milk if the batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each piece of chicken with a little milk or water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more. I really work the flour into the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until well-browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>I put mine covered in the oven for about 15 minutes. More to keep warm while cooking the rest.</li>
    </ol>

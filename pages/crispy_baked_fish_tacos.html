    <h1>Crispy Baked Fish Tacos</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons chili powder*</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper</p>
        <p>1 egg, whisked</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
        <p>To Make The Fish: Heat oven to 375째F.  Spread the panko out in an even layer on a medium baking sheet*.  Bake for 5-7 minutes, giving the pan a gentle shake halfway through, until the panko is toasted and golden brown.  (Keep a close eye on the panko so that it does not burn.) Transfer the panko to a medium bowl, and dust off the baking sheet for future use.</p>
        <p>Add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper to the bowl with the panko, then whisk the mixture until combined.</p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake the fish for 10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and opaque and flakes easily with a fork.  (Internal temperature should be 145째F*.)  Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack, then use a fork to roughly flake the fish into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>*Crispy Panko: To make the panko even crispier, feel free to toss it with 1 tablespoon of oil before toasting it in the oven.  I recommend letting the panko toast in the oven until it reaches a pretty deep golden brown for maximum crispiness.</li>
        <li>*Fish Internal Temperature: The FDA says that the safe internal temperature for cooked fish is 145째F.  I usually pull mine out of the oven around 135-140째F, since the temperature will continue to rise a few degrees more while the fish rests.</li>

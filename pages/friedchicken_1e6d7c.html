    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
    <p>3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour paprika</p>
<p>Poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper (adjust to taste) 2 eggs beaten 1 1/2 cups canned milk 1 quart vegetable oil for frying (350) Boneless Chicken breasts (approx 3 Ibs.) Directions</p>
<p>1. In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black</p>
<p>pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, Â¼ teaspoon pepper, eggs and canned milk. You may need to thin with additional milk if the batter is too thick.</p>
<p>2. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each</p>
<p>piece of chicken with a little milk or water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more. I really work the flour into the chicken pieces.</p>
<p>3. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until</p>
<p>well-browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels.</p>
<p>4. I put mine covered in the oven for about 15 minutes. More to keep warm while</p>
<p>cooking the rest.</p>

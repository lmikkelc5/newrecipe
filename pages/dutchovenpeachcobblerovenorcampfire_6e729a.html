    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Filling</li>
        <li>● 6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>● 3 pounds ripe peaches about 5-6 large or 8-9 small/medium peaches</li>
        <li>● 1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>● 2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>● 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>● 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>● 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>Topping</li>
        <li>● 3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>● 1/3 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>● 1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>● 2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>● 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>● 1/2 cup milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the oven</li>
        <li>1. Melt the butter directly in the dutch oven.</li>
        <li>2. Mix up your batter. All you need for this is a whisk and a bowl.</li>
        <li>3. Pour the batter ON TOP OF the Butter. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>4. Spoon on the peaches. Again, DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>5. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes to 1 hour. The cobbler is done when it’s</li>
        <li>edges are deeply golden and a toothpick inserted in the cake-part comes out</li>
        <li>clean.</li>
        <li>You can use a Dutch oven ranging in size from eight to 12 inches; just adjust the</li>
        <li>cooking time accordingly. A smaller Dutch oven will need longer, while a larger Dutch</li>
        <li>oven may finish cooking more quickly.</li>
        <li>Over the campfire</li>
        <li>1. Lightly butter the inside of a camp dutch oven.</li>
        <li>2. Prepare the peach filling as directed in the oven method.</li>
        <li>3. In a separate bowl, stir together the topping ingredients as directed. After adding</li>
        <li>the milk, stir in the melted butter. Spoon the fruit into the bottom of the buttered</li>
        <li>dutch oven, along with any juices that have collected. Slowly pour the batter over</li>
        <li>the top of the peaches. DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>4. Cover the dutch oven with its lid. Place 15 hot charcoal briquettes together (they</li>
        <li>will be covered with ash) and set the dutch oven over them. Using tongs, place</li>
        <li>the remaining 30 briquettes on the dutch oven lid. (This number and placement is</li>
        <li>necessary for the dutch oven to reach 350 degrees F.) (I build a platform out of</li>
        <li>burning wood and put the dutch oven on them and throw some coals on top. No</li>
        <li>need to be all fancy)</li>
        <li>5. Rotate after 10 min</li>
        <li>6. Check after 20 min, its done when the topping is golden brown and the juices are</li>
        <li>bubbling, this should take about 35 to 45 min</li>
        <li>Order is reversed to stop the cake part from burning, this means that the cake will rise</li>
        <li>more as the cake isn't weighed down by the fruit.</li>
    </ol>

<p>Breads</p>
<p>Wheat Bread</p>
<p>5 ½ c. hot water 1/3 c. oil 2/3 c. honey 3 ½ TBS lemon juice ½ c. white flour 1 TBSP salt 14-16 c. fresh ground whole wheat 2 ½ TBSP yeast  Place hot water and all ingredients except wheat and yeast in bowl and mix 30-40 seconds.  Add 2-3 c. flour.  Mix until it looks like pancake batter.  Add yeast.  Let sit 3-4 min.  Yeast will start to bubble.  Add flour 1 cup at a time until dough forms a ball.  Knead with mixer for 7 minutes.  Remove dough.  Roll out on oiled countertop.  Cut into 4-5 pieces, depending on pan size.  Place in greased pans.  Let rise 30 minutes, until 1 ¼ “ above center of pan.  Bake at 350˚, 25 min.</p>
<p>Whole Wheat Bread - Bev Monroe</p>
<p>6 c. warm water</p>
<p>2 T. yeast ¼ c. oil ¼ c. lecithin ½ c. honey ½ c. gluten powder 1 T. salt 2 T. Dough conditioner 10 c. Whole wheat flour  Pour the warm water (about 105°) into mixer.  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water. Using a 1 cup measuring cup, pour ¼ cup oil into the measuring cup first; swirl oil and coat the inside of measure cup.  Pour ½ cup honey into the cup on top of the oil—both will reach ¾ cup line.  Pour both into the mixer (honey will not stick to cup).  Next measure ¼ cup lecithin in the same measuring cup so it will also slide out with less sticking.  Add the remaining ingredients listed into the mixer and turn mixer on low and mix.  The mixture will take a few minutes to look uniform in texture.  Once this occurs, where everything is well blended together, start adding additional flour until the dough is one mass and pulls away from the sides and bottom of mixer (2-4 cups or more of flour depending on your flour).  Now this is the secret of really good bread—set the timer and knead on low speed for at least 10 minutes.  Immediately after kneading, remove dough from mixer, divide into 6 portions.  Spray loaf pans with nonstick spray; shape dough into loaves and put into bread loaf pans.  Let rise until doubled in size—about 40 minutes.  Bake 25 minutes at 350°.  Do not overbake as it dries out bread.  Freeze bread that will not be eaten in one day to keep it moist and fresh.</p>

<p>Quick and Easy Pizza Crust (allrecipes.com)</p>
<p>2 packages or 4 ½ tsp. active yeast 2 teaspoons white sugar 2 cups warm water (110 degrees F) 5 cups bread flour ¼ cup olive oil 2 teaspoon salt  Directions:</p>
<p>1.  Preheat the oven to 450°F. In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm</p>
<p>water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2.  Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes. 3.  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round.</p>
<p>Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker’s peel dusted with</p>
<p>cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
<p>Cloud Biscuits</p>
<p>(Elizabeth Ralph)</p>
<p>2 c. sifted flour</p>
<p>1 TBSP sugar</p>
<p>4 tsp. baking powder</p>
<p>½ tsp. salt</p>
<p>½ c. margarine</p>
<p>1 egg, beaten</p>
<p>2/3 c. milk</p>
<p>Sift dry ingredients.  Cut in shortening.  Combine egg and milk and add all at once.  Stir, knead about 20 strokes.  Roll dough into balls about ¾ inch thick.  Place on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake at 450˚ for 10-14 min.</p>
<p>Heavy French Bread</p>
<p>(from Sheryl Demars and Jenna Lake)</p>
<p>2 ½ c warm water 2 TBSP yeast 2 TBSP sugar 2 TBSP oil 2 tsp salt 6 c flour (more or less)  In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar.  Let froth.  Add oil, salt, and flour.  Mix well until incorporated and knead until soft.  Dust the counter with flour and place the dough on flour.  Cover and let rise until double, about one hour.  Punch down and let rise for one minute.  Divide dough in two equal parts on floured counter.  Shape into two loaves.  Place on greased and corn mealed jelly roll pan.  Both loaves will fit length-wise on one pan.  (If you desire a shiny crust, brush loaves with slightly beaten</p>
<p>egg.)  With a sharp knife, make four diagonal slashes in each loaf.  Let rise for 30 minutes and place in cold oven.  Turn oven to 400˚ and bake for 35 minutes, until very golden brown.  Let rest at least ten minutes before cutting.  I like to leave the crust without egg, as I love lots of hard, flour-dusted crust.  This is a very meaty bread.  I like to rip it instead of cut it as it reminds me of the breads (pan al horno) of my mission in Argentina.  T’otal time start to finish:  approx. 2 hrs 15 min</p>
<p>Rolls (Easy!)</p>
<p>5 c. warm water 1 Tbsp. salt 1 c. sugar 4 beaten eggs 3 Tbsp. or 3 pkg. yeast 12 to 14 c. flour can 6 Tbsp. vegetable oil Butter, melted (optional) recipe Combine water, sugar, and yeast in electric mixer bowl. Let yeast rise. Add oil, salt, and eggs; mix well. Add flour, mixing between additions. (You have enough flour when sides of mixing bowl is clean.) Put dough into a greased bow to rise; cover dough. Let rise until doubled (1½ to 2 hours). Punch risen dough down and divide into 4 sections. Roll one section out into a circle (¼ inch thick) on a greased counter. Cut circle into triangles and roll each triangle from wide end to narrow end. Place shaped roll onto greased cookie sheet and bake at 400° for 8 to 10 minutes. Orange Roll variation: Make dough and roll out same way. Mix: ½ c. sugar ½ tsp. orange extract or 1 tsp. ¼ c. softened butter or margarine grated orange rind 1 Tbsp. water or orange juice Spread onto dough before cutting and shaping rolls. Bake at 400° for 8 to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Zucchini Bread</p>
<p>1 cup oil 2 cups sugar 3 eggs 3 teaspoons vanilla 2 cups shredded raw zucchini 3 cups flour 1 teaspoon soda 1 teaspoon salt 3 teaspoons cinnamon ¼ teaspoon baking powder ½ cup chopped nuts</p>
<p>1. Combine oil, sugar, and eggs in large mixer bowl. Beat well. 2. Blend in vanilla and zucchini. Sift dry ingredients together. Add to the oil mixture</p>
<p>and blend well. Add nuts.</p>
<p>3. Pour batter into 2 loaf pans (8x4x3), well greased and lightly floured. Bake at 350</p>
<p>degrees F. for about 1 hour, or until the loaves test done. Or use 3 medium loaf pans and reduce baking time to about 30 minutes.  Let stand in pans for ten minutes, then turn out on racks to cool.</p>

<p>Enchilada Sauce</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>• Pinch of cinnamon (optional but recommended) • 2 tablespoons tomato paste • 2 cups vegetable broth • 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar • Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Instructions 1. This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and optional cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well. 2. In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it's hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don't step away from the stove! 3. Once it's ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps. 4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.) 5. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas! NOTES Enchilada sauce recipe adapted from my. spinach artichoke enchiladas. STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for expansion (don't screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen), or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing). MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Just use gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. I tried with Bob's Red Mill brand and it worked great. MAKE IT TOMATO FREE: You can omit the tomato paste. You might want to up the spices a bit. The sauce won't taste quite like the enchilada sauce you might buy at the store, but it will still be good! CHANGE IT UP: The chili powder, cumin and garlic powder are essential here, but feel free to change up the other spices to suit your preferences.</li>

        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder homemade or store-bought</li>
        <li>1 cup milk or buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil or canola oil, or melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.  For the Chocolate Cake</li>
        <li>1. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder</li>
        <li>to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.</li>
        <li>2. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on</li>
        <li>medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.</li>
        <li>3. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for</li>
        <li>30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>4. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the</li>
        <li>pan and cool completely.</li>
        <li>5. Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting below.</li>
        <li>Notes: The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted! Freezer Friendly- Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight with wrapping intact. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost. High Altitude- If you live at a high altitude, adjust the recipe based upon the altitude for your area.</li>
        <li>Chocolate Buttercream Frosting</li>
        <li>https://addapinch.com/perfect-chocolate-buttercream-frosting-recipe/</li>
        <li>1. Add cocoa to a large bowl or bowl of stand mixer. Whisk through the cocoa well</li>
        <li>to remove any lumps.</li>
        <li>2. Then, add softened butter to the bowl with cocoa. Cream together the butter and</li>
        <li>cocoa powder until well-combined.</li>
        <li>3. Next, alternately add sugar and milk to the cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of</li>
        <li>sugar followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, turn the mixer to a HIGH speed for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added. This is important – so please make sure to mix it just as described in these instructions. It makes the frosting into fluffy, delicious perfection!</li>
        <li>4. Then add your vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well. 5. If your frosting appears too dry, add more milk, only one tablespoon at a time</li>
        <li>until it reaches the right consistency.</li>
        <li>6. If it appears too wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner’s sugar,</li>
        <li>only one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.</li>
        <li>7. Frost your cake or cupcakes as desired and enjoy! 8. Thankfully, this chocolate buttercream comes together quickly and makes plenty</li>
        <li>to frost a three layer cake or three dozen cupcakes beautifully.</li>

        <li>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES</li>
        <li>(from Andrea Clawson)</li>
        <li>2 (4oz) sticks of butter salted 1 cup white sugar 1 ⅓ cups of brown sugar 2 eggs 1 ½ tsp vanilla (mexican vanilla) 2 ¾ cup flour (2 ½ if using kamut) 1 tsp salt 1 tsp baking soda ½ cup semi sweet ½ cup milk chocolate chips  DIRECTIONS: 1. cream together butter & sugar on high for 2 min 2. Add eggs and vanilla, mix 1 min or so 3. Mix flour, salt, baking soda in separate bowl then slowly add to wet mixture *DON'T over-MIX! Just barely combine 4. Add chocolate chips & fold together. 5. Bake @ 350° for 9-10 mins on a tray with parchment paper 6. When you pull them out bang the pan a few times on the counter if you want them flatter (do this while they are still hot).</li>
        <li>Confetti Cookies</li>
        <li>https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/05/confetti-cookies/ 3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt 1 cup (8 ounces, 225 grams or 2 sticks) unsalted butter 1/4 cup (2 ounces, 55 grams or 1/4 of an 8-ounce brick) cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract or 1/2 a vanilla bean, split and scraped (see Note up top) 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional) 1 cup rainbow sprinkles</li>
        <li>1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two baking large sheets with parchment paper. 2. To make in a food processor: Place flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in</li>
        <li>the work bowl and pulse a few times to blend. Add butter and cream cheese in large chunks, plus sugar and blend until mixture is powdery. Add egg, vanilla and almond extracts and run machine until the dough balls together. You’ll probably need to scrape it down once or twice to get the mixture even.</li>
        <li>3. To make with an electric mixer: Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and</li>
        <li>salt in a bowl and whisk to blend. In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat cream cheese, butter and sugar until fluffy. Add egg and extracts and blend again. Add flour mixture and beat just until flour disappears. In some cases, this dough will feel too soft to roll into balls in your hands; if so, let it chill in the fridge for 20 minutes or so before using.</li>
        <li>4. Both methods: Scoop balls of dough — I like these cookies best with a #40, or 1</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon, scoop; the texture is less dynamic when made smaller — and roll them briefly in the palms of your hands before dropping them in a bowl of rainbow sprinkles and gently rolling to coat them evenly. I find that the sprinkles adhere much better to the tacky exterior of balls of dough that have been briefly warmed by your hands — trust me here.</li>
        <li>5. Transfer balls of sprinkle-coated dough to baking sheets at least two inches</li>
        <li>apart. Use the bottom of a drinking glass to press down on the cookies until they are about 1/4 to 1/2-inch tall. If you see any bare spots in the sprinkles that bother you, you can sprinkle a few more on top. Bake for 9 to 10 minutes until they look underbaked but lightly golden underneath. [If they’re not quite soft in the center, they will be fully crisped through the next day.] Let set on the baking sheet on a rack for a few minutes before transferring to cooling racks to cool the rest of the way. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.</li>

        <li>1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>2) In a small bowl, mix flour, cocoa, soda and salt using a wire whisk and set aside.</li>
        <li>3) In another bowl, cream butter, sugar and crisco until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>4) Add eggs and vanilla and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>5) Add flour mixture to creamed mixture and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>6) Stir in mint chips and chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>7) Roll cookie dough into 1-1/4 inch balls.</li>
        <li>8) Place on parchment paper covered baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Cookies will still be soft but will set up after cooling. Place cookies on cookie rack to cool. Makes about 3 dozen cookies.</li>
        <li>Cookie Glaze</li>
        <li>2 cup powdered sugar 1 TBSP milk 6 TBSP light corn syrup  Mix sugar, milk, corn syrup. Add more corn syrup, a TBSP at a time to thin if needed. Tint with coloring.  If sprinkles are used, add immediately.  This is a flow frosting, it should be fairly thick consistency but still spreadable. Frosting will flow slightly for a smooth look.</li>
        <li>Creamy Vanilla Frosting</li>
        <li>3 cups powdered sugar 1/3 cup margarine- softened 1 ½ teaspoon vanilla 2 tablespoons milk  Mix sugar and butter. Stir in vanilla and milk. Beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Raspberry Buttercream Frosting</li>
        <li>https://goodiegodmother.com/raspberry-buttercream-frosting/</li>
        <li>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) **</li>
        <li>1/2 lb salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>7 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1. Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using</li>
        <li>the back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze</li>
        <li>out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This</li>
        <li>makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</li>
        <li>2. In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle</li>
        <li>attachment, cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the</li>
        <li>powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after</li>
        <li>each addition.</li>
        <li>3. Once you've added 5 cups of sugar, add the raspberry puree. Continue</li>
        <li>adding the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</li>
        <li>4. If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add</li>
        <li>a little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>5. Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with</li>
        <li>plastic wrap pressed along to top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting.</li>
        <li>Re-whip before using.</li>
        <li>Note</li>
        <li>**Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.</li>

        <li>The BEST SOFT Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
        <li>https://pinchofyum.com/the-best-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar 1 cup sugar 2 sticks melted salted butter 2 eggs 2 tsp vanilla 3 cups of flour 1 tsp baking soda ½ tsp salt 1 ½  cups Chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 60 seconds to</li>
        <li>just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid</li>
        <li>form.</li>
        <li>2. Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until</li>
        <li>creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated –</li>
        <li>10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).</li>
        <li>3. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to</li>
        <li>press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is</li>
        <li>easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the</li>
        <li>chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.</li>
        <li>4. Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place</li>
        <li>on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and</li>
        <li>just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is</li>
        <li>probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for</li>
        <li>keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet</li>
        <li>(see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.</li>
        <li>5. Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or</li>
        <li>five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these</li>
        <li>dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay</li>
        <li>soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.</li>
        <li>Graham Cracker Crust (Marissa)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup margarine or butter ¼ cup sugar 1 ¼ cups finely crushed graham crackers (about 18 crackers)  Melt butter. Stir in sugar.  Add crushed graham crackers.  Toss to mix well.  Spread evenly into a 9-inch pie plate.  Press onto bottom and sides to form a firm, even crust. Chill about 1 hour or till firm.  (Or bake at 375 for 4-5 minutes or until the edge is lightly browned.  Cool on a wire rack before filling.)</li>
        <li>Graham Cracker Crust</li>
        <li>From https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-a-perfect-graham-cracker-crust/   1 and 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 full sheet graham crackers) 5 Tablespoons (72g) unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar  Instructions:</li>
        <li>1. If you’re starting out with full-sheet graham crackers, you can use a food</li>
        <li>2. Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and granulated sugar together</li>
        <li>with a rubber spatula in a medium bowl until combined. The mixture will be thick,</li>
        <li>coarse, and sandy. Press the mixture into the bottom of the dish or pan and slightly up the sides. This crust will fit into a 9 – 10 inch pan. Make sure it is tight and compact. Use the bottom of a flat measuring cup like I do in these photos. It helps! The crust will be thick.</li>
        <li>3. For a baked dessert, pre-bake this crust per your recipe’s directions. I usually</li>
        <li>pre-bake for 10 minutes at 300°F (149°C) or 7-8 minutes at 350°F (177°C). For a no-bake dessert, chill the crust for 2 hours before using in your recipe.</li>
        <li>Make Ahead & Freeze Instructions: It’s freezer friendly! Freeze the prepared crust in your pan for up to 3 months. Thaw before using in your recipe. For shorter storage, keep the prepared crust in the refrigerator for a few days before using in your recipe. Variations: Use cinnamon, honey, or chocolate flavor graham crackers depending on your dessert recipe. I usually use honey flavor because it is the most mild. If I’m baking a chocolate treat, I like to switch things up and use the chocolate graham crackers. Try using brown sugar instead of granulated sugar for a hint of molasses flavor.</li>
        <li>Strawberry Pie</li>
        <li>9 inch baked pie shell or graham cracker crust 6 cups strawberries 1 cup sugar 3 TBS cornstarch ½ cup water 1 pkg (3 oz) cream cheese, softened  Mash enough strawberries to make 1 cup.  Mix sugar and cornstarch in 2 qt saucepan. Gradually stir in water and mashed strawberries.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils.  Boil and stir for one minute.  Cool.  Beat cream cheese smooth and spread on bottom of pie shell.  Fill graham cracker crust with remaining strawberries.  Pour cooled strawberry mixture over top.  Refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours.  8 servings, 320 calories per serving.  Can use peaches or raspberries instead of strawberries. (For peaches, to prevent discoloration, dip peaches in an ascorbic acid mixture.)  Note: I usually leave out the cream cheese and I have often used peaches without the ascorbic acid… this recipe makes a great peach pie.</li>
        <li>Note: Cream cheese can help the graham cracker crust last longer. Also, lemon juice works well for the peach pie instead of ascorbic acid. No problems with color changing and it still tastes great!</li>

        <li>Raspberry Frosting</li>
        <li>https://goodiegodmother.com/raspberry-buttercream-frosting/</li>
        <li>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) ** 1/2 lb salted butter, softened 1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened 7 cups powdered sugar **Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.  Instructions</li>
        <li>1. Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using the</li>
        <li>back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</li>
        <li>2. In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,</li>
        <li>cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after each addition.</li>

        <li>the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</li>
        <li>4. If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add a</li>
        <li>little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>5. Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with plastic</li>
        <li>wrap pressed along to the top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting. Re-whip before using.</li>
        <li>High Tea Lemon Cookies</li>
        <li>(from English Trifle by Josi Kilpack)</li>
        <li>Cookies 2 cups butter (room temperature) 2/3 cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 1 3/4 cups flour 1 1/2 cups cornstarch (this is not a typo)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat butter until creamy. Add powdered sugar and mix until light and fluffy. Add lemon zest and vanilla. Beat well. Add flour and cornstarch and beat until well combined. Do NOT refrigerate.  Roll by hand into 1-inch balls or use a well-packed scoop, placing cookies about an inch apart as they do not spread much while baking.  Bake for 15 minutes on ungreased cookie sheets until bottom edges are light brown. Cool on wire racks before frosting with lemon glaze (below).  Makes about 5 dozen small, delicate cookies.  Lemon Glaze 4 tablespoons butter 3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest (get zest from lemon before juicing) 1/4 to 1/3 cup lemon juice*ch we 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar  In a medium bowl combine butter, zest, juice, and sugar. Stir until well mixed. Place a piece of wax paper beneath the wire racks where the cookies have been cooling and drizzle glaze over cookies.  * For best results when using lemons, choose the largest lemon you can find and roll it on the counter for about a minute before juicing in order to get as much juice as</li>
        <li>possible.  Zest only the yellow part of the lemon peel; the white portion leaves a bitter taste.</li>

        <li>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
        <li>(from The Frog Commissary Cookbook )</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, room temperature 1 cup sugar 1 cup brown sugar 2 large eggs 2 tbsp milk 2 tsp vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda 1 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt 2 1/2 cups oats (rolled or "quick," but not "instant") 2 cups of chocolate chips (about 12-oz.)  Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and the sugars until mixture is light in color. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the milk and the vanilla extract. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Either by hand or with the mixer on low speed, gradually beat the flour in to the sugar mixture until just incorporated. Stir in the oats and chocolate chips by hand. Drop 1-inch balls of dough onto the cookie sheet, placing about 1 1/2 inches apart so they have room to spread. Bake at 350F for 10-13 minutes, until golden brown at the edges and light golden at the center. Cool on baking sheet for at least 1-2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Makes 4 dozen.  Notes : - If you chill the dough for about 30 minutes before baking, you will have a slightly puffier cookie. - You can substitute raisins for the chocolate chips. - You can add up to 1 1/2 cups chopped nuts in addition to raisins or chocolate chips. You might want to make the cookies slightly larger if this is the case.</li>

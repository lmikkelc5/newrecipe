    <h1>Korean Ground Turkey & Rice Bowls</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>1 pound ground turkey</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic, grated or minced</p>
        <p>1/4 cup honey</p>
        <p>1/4 cup soy sauce</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons sesame oil</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (Fairly spicy, use less red pepper flakes for more mild taste)</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>green onion & sesame seeds for garnish</p>
        <p>In a large skillet, over medium heat brown the ground turkey 8-10 minutes until fully cooked.</p>
        <p>While turkey is cooking, make the sauce. Add garlic, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, red pepper flakes, and black pepper to a bowl. Mix together.</p>
        <p>Once turkey is fully cooked add the sauce to the skillet. Cook 3-4 minutes until the sauce thickens/absorbs into the turkey.</p>
        <p>Serve the turkey over the rice. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.</p>

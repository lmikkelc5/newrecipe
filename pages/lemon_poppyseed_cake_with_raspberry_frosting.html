        <p>3/4 cup unsalted butter, (12 Tbsp), softened</p>
        <p>1 cup granulated sugar</p>
        <p>3 large eggs, room temperature</p>
        <p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>2 1/2 tsp baking powder</p>
        <p>2 Tbsp poppy seeds, sifted to remove any debris</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp lemon zest, (from 2 large lemons)</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp lemon juice</p>
        <p>1 tsp vanilla extract</p>
        <p>1/2 cup buttermilk, room temperature</p>
        <p>How to Make Lemon Poppy Seed Cake:</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350˚F with a rack in the center of the oven. Butter the sides and base of two 9" cake pans and line the bottom of each pan with a ring parchment paper.</p>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl with an electric hand mixer, cream together 12 Tbsp softened butter and 1 cup sugar for 2 minutes on high speed. Add eggs one at a time mixing just until incorporated.</p>
        <p>In a small bowl, whisk together 2 cups flour, 2 1/2 tsp baking powder and 2 Tbsp poppy seeds. Add half of the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</p>
        <p>Add 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp lemon zest and 1 tsp vanilla, mixing just to combine. With mixer on low speed, add 1/2 cup buttermilk then mix in remaining half of the flour mixture, mixing until no lumps remain. Divide between 2 prepared pans and spread evenly.</p>
        <p>Bake at 350˚F for 20-23 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cake cook in pans 10 minutes then transfer to wire racks, remove backing and and cool to room temperature.</p>
        <p>Raspberry Frosting</p>
        <p>https://goodiegodmother.com/raspberry-buttercream-frosting/</p>
        <p>6 oz fresh raspberries (about 1 1/2 cups) **</p>
        <p>1/2 lb salted butter, softened</p>
        <p>1/2 lb unsalted butter, softened</p>
        <p>7 cups powdered sugar</p>
        <p>**Feel free to use frozen berries, just thaw them first.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the fresh raspberries into a fine-mesh sieve over a mixing bowl. Using the back of a spoon, press the fruit against the sides of the sieve to squeeze out the juices and some of the pulp, leaving the seeds in the sieve. This makes about 1/2 cup of smooth puree/juice.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butters together until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, scraping the bowl and mixing on low after each addition.</li>
        <li>Once you've added 5 cups of sugar, add the raspberry puree. Continue adding the remaining two cups of sugar as before.</li>
        <li>If your frosting is too thick, add a little heavy cream to thin, if it's too thin, add a little more powdered sugar until the desired consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Store frosting up to 5 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container with plastic wrap pressed along to the top surface of the frosting to prevent crusting. Re-whip before using.</li>
    </ol>

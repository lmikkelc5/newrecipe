    <h1>Grandma Lambert’s Molasses Cookies</h1>
    <p>This recipe is from my great-grandma Marjorie Linton Lambert and these have always been some of my favorite cookies! She was an amazing homemaker and taught my grandma Lambert how to do a lot of the things that were considered essential for running a home (knitting, crocheting and sewing). My grandma has taught me and all of my sisters how to do many of those things and it just adds to my great-grandma Lambert’s legacy. These cookies taste like fall with some of those spices that we love at this time of year and they’re so easy to make. Enjoy!  ¾ cup shortening (margarine) 1 cup sugar 1 egg ¼ cup molasses 2 cup flour 1 teaspoon cinnamon ½ teaspoon cloves ½ teaspoon ginger 2 teaspoons baking soda  Make small balls 1 tablespoon, dip in sugar and bake for 8 minutes at 350˚.</p>

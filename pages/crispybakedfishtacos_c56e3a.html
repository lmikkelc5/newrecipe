    <h1>Crispy Baked Fish Tacos</h1>
    <p>https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fish-tacos/#tasty-recipes-59652</p>
<p>● 1 cup panko breadcrumbs</p>
<p>● 2 teaspoons chili powder*</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>● 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper</p>
<p>● 1 egg, whisked</p>
<p>● 1 1/2 pounds firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p>1. To Make The Fish: Heat oven to 375°F.  Spread the panko out in an even layer</p>
<p>on a medium baking sheet*.  Bake for 5-7 minutes, giving the pan a gentle shake</p>
<p>halfway through, until the panko is toasted and golden brown.  (Keep a close eye</p>
<p>on the panko so that it does not burn.) Transfer the panko to a medium bowl, and</p>
<p>dust off the baking sheet for future use.</p>
<p>2. Add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper to the bowl with the panko,</p>
<p>then whisk the mixture until combined.</p>
<p>3. Now, set up an assembly line with the (1) fish, (2) whisked egg, (3) panko mixture</p>
<p>and (4) parchment-covered baking sheet.  Using your right hand, dip a piece of</p>
<p>fish in the egg so that it is coated on all sides.  Then, using your left hand,</p>
<p>transfer the fish to the panko mixture and gently press it on so that the fish is</p>
<p>coated on all sides.  Using your left hand, transfer the fish to the baking sheet.</p>
<p>Then repeat the process with the remaining fish.</p>
<p>4. Bake the fish for 10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and opaque and flakes</p>
<p>easily with a fork.  (Internal temperature should be 145°F*.)  Transfer baking</p>
<p>sheet to a wire rack, then use a fork to roughly flake the fish into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>*Crispy Panko: To make the panko even crispier, feel free to toss it with 1 tablespoon of</p>
<p>oil before toasting it in the oven.  I recommend letting the panko toast in the oven until it</p>
<p>reaches a pretty deep golden brown for maximum crispiness.</p>
<p>*Fish Internal Temperature: The FDA says that the safe internal temperature for cooked</p>
<p>fish is 145°F.  I usually pull mine out of the oven around 135-140°F, since the</p>
<p>temperature will continue to rise a few degrees more while the fish rests.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy texture. Remove</li>
        <li>any skin and cut the salmon into 1-inch bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>2. Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with</li>
        <li>garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
        <li>3. Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make the Bang Bang Sauce</li>
        <li>1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce,</li>
        <li>sriracha, honey, and lime juice until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>2. Taste and adjust the sauce—add more sriracha for heat or honey for sweetness.</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Cook the Salmon</li>
        <li>1. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a small amount of</li>
        <li>olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>2. Once the oil is hot, add the salmon pieces in a single layer, making sure not to</li>
        <li>overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if needed.</li>
        <li>3. Sear the salmon for 2-3 minutes per side, gently turning to brown all sides. Cook</li>
        <li>until the salmon is golden and crispy on the outside, tender and flaky inside.</li>
        <li>4. Transfer cooked salmon bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess</li>
        <li>oil.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Coat in Bang Bang Sauce  Drizzle it: Place the salmon bites on a serving platter and drizzle the sauce over them. Toss it: Add the salmon bites to a bowl, pour the sauce over, and gently toss to coat.  Step 5: Garnish and Serve</li>
        <li>1. Garnish the salmon bites with chopped parsley, green onions, or sesame seeds</li>
        <li>for extra flavor and color.</li>
        <li>2. Serve immediately to enjoy their crispy texture and vibrant flavors.</li>
        <li>Tips for Achieving Maximum Crispiness</li>
        <li>The key to perfectly Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites lies in a few simple but essential</li>
        <li>techniques. Follow these tips to ensure your salmon bites are irresistibly crunchy every</li>
        <li>time.</li>
        <li>Pat the Salmon Dry</li>
        <li>Removing excess moisture is crucial for crispiness. Use a paper towel to thoroughly pat</li>
        <li>the salmon pieces dry before seasoning. This prevents steaming during cooking and</li>
        <li>ensures a golden, crispy exterior.</li>
        <li>Use Cornstarch or Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>For an extra crispy coating, lightly dust the salmon pieces with cornstarch before</li>
        <li>cooking. Alternatively, coat them in panko breadcrumbs for added crunch. Panko’s airy</li>
        <li>texture creates a delightful crispness that regular breadcrumbs can’t achieve. For more</li>
        <li>tips on breading techniques, explore this guide.</li>
        <li>Avoid Overcrowding the Pan or Air Fryer</li>
        <li>Overcrowding lowers the cooking temperature, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy</li>
        <li>salmon. Cook in small batches, leaving enough space between pieces to allow air</li>
        <li>circulation or consistent heat distribution.</li>
        <li>Maintain the Right Oil Temperature</li>
        <li>Whether pan-searing or air-frying, ensure the oil is hot enough (around 375°F/190°C)</li>
        <li>before adding the salmon. Proper oil temperature prevents sticking and sogginess while</li>
        <li>achieving a crisp outer layer. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the salmon will absorb it, losing</li>
        <li>its crunch.</li>
    </ul>

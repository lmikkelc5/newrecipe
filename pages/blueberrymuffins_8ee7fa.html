    <h1>Blueberry Muffins</h1>
    <p>Muffin Batter:  1 ½ cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p>¾ cup sugar</p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>1/3 cup vegetable oil</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>1/3 cup milk</p>
<p>1 cup fresh blueberries</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400˚. Grease muffin tins or line with muffin liners. Combine flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Place vegetable oil into a 1 cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup. Mix this with the flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill the muffin cups to the top and sprinkle with crumb topping mixture.  Crumb Topping: (makes a lot, see note at end)  ½ cup sugar</p>
<p>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p>¼ cup butter, cubed</p>
<p>1 ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
<p>With a fork, mix all ingredients together; sprinkle over muffins before baking. Bake for 20-25 minutes in preheated oven.</p>
<p>Note: Recipe makes one dozen muffins. I usually double the recipe and single the topping (or half the topping for a single recipe).</p>

    <h1>Oven Roasted Asparagus</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>Original recipe makes 4 servings</p>
        <p>1 bunch thin asparagus spears, trimmed</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>1 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, minced (optional) (or garlic powder sprinkled on)</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon sea salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</p>
        <p>(I donâ€™t use anywhere near that much salt and pepper.  I just sprinkle on)</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</p>
        <p>1.   Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
        <p>2.  Place the asparagus into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss to coat the spears, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange the asparagus onto a baking sheet in a single layer.</p>
        <p>3.  Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes depending on thickness. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving.</p>
        <p>Cook's Note</p>
        <p>To remove woody ends, grab stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.</p>

<p>HOW TO MAKE THE SOUP  There are three parts to making this: the chicken, the gnocchi, and the base of the soup!  First up, THE CHICKEN:  This is where we get to incorporate a lot of flavor into this soup with some very well-seasoned juicy chicken. We will be using chicken breast and marinating it with the following ingredients:  olive oil italian seasoning lemon pepper smoked paprika garlic powder salt black pepper In a bowl, add the chicken breast, olive oil, Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix to marinade evenly.  Heat an oiled skillet or pan over medium-high heat.  Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook on each side until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes each side, depending how thick the breast is. Then drop the heat to low and allow the chicken to cook through to the center or the temperature registers 165°F. Remove the chicken from the pan and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Chop the chicken into cubes now and set aside. If you prefer shredded chicken in the soup instead of cubed, feel free to shred it. SOUP BASE butter olive oil garlic</p>
<p>carrots yellow onion celery chicken broth half and half flour spices parsley basil parmesan Start by sautéing the garlic, chopped carrots, diced onion, and chopped celery in a little bit of butter and oil in a large pot. Cook just until the onions are softened. Then add the chicken broth. Combine the half and half with flour by whisking together in a bowl and then add to the pot. The flour acts as a thickener for the soup just to make it a bit more creamy. Mix all together and then add the following spices to season it up: black pepper, Italian seasoning, sweet paprika, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and salt. Cover and let it simmer for 30 minutes just for flavors to meld in nicely.  After 30 minutes, take off the lid and add parmesan, parsley, red pepper flakes, basil, and the gnocchi. Mix together and let the gnocchi cook for about 9 minutes or until soft. The last step is to toss some spinach in there, taste the soup, adjust any seasoning, and take off the heat to enjoy! To make this even lighter, you can swap the half and half with milk or to make it even more creamy, you can use heavy cream!  https://moribyan.com/chicken-gnocchi-soup/</p>

<p>Crispy Baked Fish Tacos</p>
<p>https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fish-tacos/#tasty-recipes-59652</p>
<p>● 1 cup panko breadcrumbs</p>
<p>● 2 teaspoons chili powder*</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
<p>● 1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
<p>● 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper</p>
<p>● 1 egg, whisked</p>
<p>● 1 1/2 pounds firm white fish, such as cod or halibut, cut into 2-inch pieces</p>
<p>1. To Make The Fish: Heat oven to 375°F.  Spread the panko out in an even layer</p>
<p>on a medium baking sheet*.  Bake for 5-7 minutes, giving the pan a gentle shake</p>
<p>halfway through, until the panko is toasted and golden brown.  (Keep a close eye</p>
<p>on the panko so that it does not burn.) Transfer the panko to a medium bowl, and</p>
<p>dust off the baking sheet for future use.</p>
<p>2. Add chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper to the bowl with the panko,</p>
<p>then whisk the mixture until combined.</p>
<p>3. Now, set up an assembly line with the (1) fish, (2) whisked egg, (3) panko mixture</p>
<p>and (4) parchment-covered baking sheet.  Using your right hand, dip a piece of</p>
<p>fish in the egg so that it is coated on all sides.  Then, using your left hand,</p>
<p>transfer the fish to the panko mixture and gently press it on so that the fish is</p>
<p>coated on all sides.  Using your left hand, transfer the fish to the baking sheet.</p>
<p>Then repeat the process with the remaining fish.</p>
<p>4. Bake the fish for 10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and opaque and flakes</p>
<p>easily with a fork.  (Internal temperature should be 145°F*.)  Transfer baking</p>
<p>sheet to a wire rack, then use a fork to roughly flake the fish into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>*Crispy Panko: To make the panko even crispier, feel free to toss it with 1 tablespoon of</p>
<p>oil before toasting it in the oven.  I recommend letting the panko toast in the oven until it</p>
<p>reaches a pretty deep golden brown for maximum crispiness.</p>
<p>*Fish Internal Temperature: The FDA says that the safe internal temperature for cooked</p>
<p>fish is 145°F.  I usually pull mine out of the oven around 135-140°F, since the</p>
<p>temperature will continue to rise a few degrees more while the fish rests.</p>
<p>Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites</p>
<p>https://grammyrecipes.com/crispy-bang-bang-salmon-bites/</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy texture. Remove</li>
        <li>any skin and cut the salmon into 1-inch bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>2. Place the salmon pieces in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with</li>
        <li>garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
        <li>3. Toss gently to coat the salmon evenly with the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make the Bang Bang Sauce</li>
        <li>1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chili sauce,</li>
        <li>sriracha, honey, and lime juice until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>2. Taste and adjust the sauce—add more sriracha for heat or honey for sweetness.</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Cook the Salmon</li>
        <li>1. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a small amount of</li>
        <li>olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>2. Once the oil is hot, add the salmon pieces in a single layer, making sure not to</li>
        <li>overcrowd the pan. Work in batches if needed.</li>
        <li>3. Sear the salmon for 2-3 minutes per side, gently turning to brown all sides. Cook</li>
        <li>until the salmon is golden and crispy on the outside, tender and flaky inside.</li>
        <li>4. Transfer cooked salmon bites to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess</li>
        <li>oil.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Coat in Bang Bang Sauce  Drizzle it: Place the salmon bites on a serving platter and drizzle the sauce over them. Toss it: Add the salmon bites to a bowl, pour the sauce over, and gently toss to coat.  Step 5: Garnish and Serve</li>
        <li>1. Garnish the salmon bites with chopped parsley, green onions, or sesame seeds</li>
        <li>for extra flavor and color.</li>
        <li>2. Serve immediately to enjoy their crispy texture and vibrant flavors.</li>
        <li>Tips for Achieving Maximum Crispiness</li>
        <li>The key to perfectly Crispy Bang Bang Salmon Bites lies in a few simple but essential</li>
        <li>techniques. Follow these tips to ensure your salmon bites are irresistibly crunchy every</li>
        <li>time.</li>
        <li>Pat the Salmon Dry</li>
        <li>Removing excess moisture is crucial for crispiness. Use a paper towel to thoroughly pat</li>
        <li>the salmon pieces dry before seasoning. This prevents steaming during cooking and</li>
        <li>ensures a golden, crispy exterior.</li>
        <li>Use Cornstarch or Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>For an extra crispy coating, lightly dust the salmon pieces with cornstarch before</li>
        <li>cooking. Alternatively, coat them in panko breadcrumbs for added crunch. Panko’s airy</li>
        <li>texture creates a delightful crispness that regular breadcrumbs can’t achieve. For more</li>
        <li>tips on breading techniques, explore this guide.</li>
        <li>Avoid Overcrowding the Pan or Air Fryer</li>
        <li>Overcrowding lowers the cooking temperature, leading to unevenly cooked or soggy</li>
        <li>salmon. Cook in small batches, leaving enough space between pieces to allow air</li>
        <li>circulation or consistent heat distribution.</li>
        <li>Maintain the Right Oil Temperature</li>
        <li>Whether pan-searing or air-frying, ensure the oil is hot enough (around 375°F/190°C)</li>
        <li>before adding the salmon. Proper oil temperature prevents sticking and sogginess while</li>
        <li>achieving a crisp outer layer. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the salmon will absorb it, losing</li>
        <li>its crunch.</li>

        <li>3.  Heat cooking oil in a large pan over medium high heat. 4. Using a heaping tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the mixture into</li>
        <li>the pan. Cook nuggets 3-5 minutes and flip, using the back of your spatula to</li>
        <li>gently flatten them a bit. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes or until outside of the nugget has a slightly golden color.</li>

        <li>Instant Pot Quinoa Burrito Bowls (Vegan!)</li>
        <li>These Instant Pot Vegan Quinoa Burrito Bowls are an easy and healthy make-ahead meal loaded with fiber and protein. PREP TIME 5 minutes COOK TIME 20 minutes TOTAL TIME 25 minutes  1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 red onion, diced 1 bell pepper, diced 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 cup quinoa, rinsed well 1 cup prepared salsa 1 cup water 1 1/2 cups cooked black beans, or 1 (15 oz.) can, drained and rinsed Optional toppings: Avocado, guacamole, fresh cilantro, green onions, salsa, lime wedges, shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1. Heat the oil in the bottom of the Instant Pot, using the "Saute" setting. Saute the</li>
        <li>onions and peppers until they start to soften, about 5 to 8 minutes, then add in cumin and salt and saute another minute. Turn off the Instant Pot for a moment.</li>
        <li>2. Add in the quinoa and water and stir well, making sure to scrape the bottom of</li>
        <li>the pot with a wooden spoon, to make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom. (This will trigger a burn error.) Add the salsa and beans on top without stirring again. Secure the lid and move the steam release valve to "Sealing."</li>
        <li>3. Press the Rice button (which cooks at LOW pressure for 12 minutes) or press the</li>
        <li>Manual or Pressure Cook button, and cook at high pressure for 1 minute. Let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes when the cooking cycle is complete, to let the quinoa finish cooking, without burning to the bottom of the pot. When the screen reads L0:15, move the steam release valve to Venting to release any remaining pressure.</li>
        <li>4. When the floating valve in the lid has dropped, it's safe to remove the lid. Fluff the</li>
        <li>quinoa with a fork, then serve warm with any toppings you love, such as avocado, diced onions, salsa, and shredded lettuce.</li>
        <li>5. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. You</li>
        <li>can quickly reheat on the stove top, or serve cold!</li>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the oven</li>
        <li>1. Melt the butter directly in the dutch oven.</li>
        <li>2. Mix up your batter. All you need for this is a whisk and a bowl.</li>
        <li>3. Pour the batter ON TOP OF the Butter. Do not stir.</li>
        <li>4. Spoon on the peaches. Again, DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>5. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes to 1 hour. The cobbler is done when it’s</li>
        <li>edges are deeply golden and a toothpick inserted in the cake-part comes out</li>
        <li>clean.</li>
        <li>You can use a Dutch oven ranging in size from eight to 12 inches; just adjust the</li>
        <li>cooking time accordingly. A smaller Dutch oven will need longer, while a larger Dutch</li>
        <li>oven may finish cooking more quickly.</li>
        <li>Over the campfire</li>
        <li>1. Lightly butter the inside of a camp dutch oven.</li>
        <li>2. Prepare the peach filling as directed in the oven method.</li>
        <li>3. In a separate bowl, stir together the topping ingredients as directed. After adding</li>
        <li>the milk, stir in the melted butter. Spoon the fruit into the bottom of the buttered</li>
        <li>dutch oven, along with any juices that have collected. Slowly pour the batter over</li>
        <li>the top of the peaches. DO NOT STIR.</li>
        <li>4. Cover the dutch oven with its lid. Place 15 hot charcoal briquettes together (they</li>
        <li>will be covered with ash) and set the dutch oven over them. Using tongs, place</li>
        <li>the remaining 30 briquettes on the dutch oven lid. (This number and placement is</li>
        <li>necessary for the dutch oven to reach 350 degrees F.) (I build a platform out of</li>
        <li>burning wood and put the dutch oven on them and throw some coals on top. No</li>
        <li>need to be all fancy)</li>
        <li>5. Rotate after 10 min</li>
        <li>6. Check after 20 min, its done when the topping is golden brown and the juices are</li>
        <li>bubbling, this should take about 35 to 45 min</li>
        <li>Order is reversed to stop the cake part from burning, this means that the cake will rise</li>
        <li>more as the cake isn't weighed down by the fruit.</li>
        <li>Easy Black Beans</li>
        <li>1 TBSP vegetable oil 1 med. Yellow onion, chopped 1 small red pepper, chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 15. oz can of black beans, drained ½ c. long grain rice 1 ½ c. chicken broth ¼ tsp. red pepper flakes ¼ tsp. dried thyme 1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>½ c. shredded cheese Tortillas  In a large, heavy sauce pan, heat the oil over medium heat for one minute.  Add the onion and pepper and cook, stirring, for 5 min. or until the onion is soft.  Add the garlic, beans, rice, chicken broth, red pepper, thyme and bay leaf and bring to a boil.  Adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles gently.  Cover and simmer for 20 min or until the rice is tender.  Remove the bay leaf and stir in the cheese.  Roll up in tortillas and serve.</li>

        <li>French Dip Beef Sandwiches</li>
        <li>1 can beef consomme 1 can French onion soup 1 can (or one cup if using bouillon cubes) beef broth 1 Roast of your choice</li>
        <li>Throw it all in the crock pot for a few hours.  Serve on French rolls…and don’t forget to serve it “au jus” for dipping!</li>
        <li>Fried Chicken</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic salt 1 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour paprika</li>
        <li>Poultry seasoning 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 tablespoon ground black pepper (adjust to taste) 2 eggs beaten 1 1/2 cups canned milk 1 quart vegetable oil for frying (350) Boneless Chicken breasts (approx 3 Ibs.) Directions</li>
        <li>1. In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black</li>
        <li>pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, eggs and canned milk. You may need to thin with additional milk if the batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>2. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each</li>
        <li>piece of chicken with a little milk or water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more. I really work the flour into the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>3. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 10 to 15 minutes, or until</li>
        <li>well-browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>4. I put mine covered in the oven for about 15 minutes. More to keep warm while</li>

        <li>Grilled Chicken Sandwiches</li>
        <li>https://www.spendwithpennies.com/grilled-chicken-sandwich/    Ingredients</li>
        <li>● 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts about 4 small breasts ● 4 hamburger buns or brioche rolls ● ¼ cup honey mustard sauce * or mayonnaise ● toppings as desired (see notes)</li>
        <li>Marinade</li>
        <li>● 3 tablespoons vegetable oil ● 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar ● 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard ● 1 tablespoon brown sugar ● 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>● ½ teaspoon salt ● ½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1. Place the chicken breast on a cutting board and lightly cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Use the flat side of a meat mallet to pound chicken breasts to ½-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl or freezer bag. Add chicken and toss</li>
        <li>well to combine. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat (375°F). 4. Remove the chicken from the marinade allowing excess to drip off and discard</li>
        <li>the marinade.</li>
        <li>5. Add the chicken to the grill and cook for 5-6 minutes per side or until no pink</li>
        <li>remains and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>
        <li>6. While chicken is cooking, brush the cut side of the buns with olive oil and place</li>
        <li>face down on the grill. Cook until lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>7. Spread each bun with honey mustard and add lettuce, tomatoes and onions if</li>
        <li>desired. Top with chicken and serve.</li>
        <li>Notes -If your chicken breasts are larger, they can be cut to make 4 portions. -Do not overcook the chicken, it is pounded to cook evenly and only needs about 10-12 minutes. -Chicken breasts can be replaced with boneless skinless chicken thighs. -Homemade Honey Mustard: Combine ⅓ cup mayonnaise, 1 ½ tablespoons yellow mustard, 1 ½ tablespoons honey &  ½ teaspoon garlic powder. -Optional toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, sliced red onion, pickles -Leftover chicken can be stored for up to 4 days in an airtight container.</li>

        <li>https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/moms_ground_turkey_and_peppers/</li>
        <li>Herb Roasted Pork</li>
        <li>1 tsp rubbed sage ½ tsp salt ¼ tsp pepper 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin ½ c sugar 1 TBSP cornstarch</li>
        <li>¼ c vinegar ¼ c water 2 TBSP soy sauce  Preheat oven to 325˚  In a bowl, combine sage, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Rub thoroughly all over pork.  Place pork in an uncovered roasting pan on the middle oven rack.  Bake in the preheated oven approximately 3 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 145˚, depending on your desired doneness.  Meanwhile, place sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and soy sauce in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to bubble and thicken slightly.  Brush roast with glaze 3 or 4 times during the last ½ hour of cooking.  Pour remaining glaze over roast and serve.  Note:  Sear the roast after rubbing with spices and before putting in the oven.  Other pork recipes call for an internal temp of 180.  I think I like 160.</li>

        <li>4. Heat both oils in a large sauté pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add</li>
        <li>the chicken breasts to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the first side is golden brown. Flip and continue cooking until done, 2-3 minutes longer. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.</li>
        <li>*If chicken breasts are large (8 or more ounces), you can cut them in half once they are pounded out.</li>

        <li>Perfect Pie Crust</li>
        <li>https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/perfect_pie_crust/   All Butter Crust  2 1/2 cups all purpose flour,  plus extra for rolling 1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, very cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 6 to 8 tablespoons ice water  Combination Butter and Shortening Crust  2 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons sugar 3/4 cup (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4 inch cubes 1/2 cup vegetable shortening 8 tablespoons ice water Egg Wash 1 tablespoon heavy cream, half and half, or milk 1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Put flour, sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food</li>
        <li>2. Add the butter, half at a time, pulsing several times after each addition. Add</li>
        <li>about half of the butter to the food processor and pulse several times. Then add</li>
        <li>the rest of the butter and pulse 6 to 8 times until the largest pieces of butter are about the size of large peas.</li>
        <li>3. Slowly add the ice water. Sprinkle the mixture with 4 tablespoons of the ice water</li>
        <li>(make sure there are no ice cubes in the water!) and pulse again. Then add more ice water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing once or twice after each addition until the dough just barely begins to hold together. You may not need all the water.</li>
        <li>4. The mixture is ready when a small handful of the crumbly dough holds together</li>
        <li>when you pinch it with your fingers.</li>
        <li>5. Make two dough discs: 6. Carefully empty the crumbly dough mixture from the food processor on to a</li>
        <li>clean, dry, flat surface. Gather the mixture in a mound.</li>
        <li>7. Divide the dough mixture into two even-sized mounds. Use your hands and</li>
        <li>knead each mound just enough to form each one into a disc. Do not over-knead! Kneading develops gluten which will toughen the dough, not something you want in a pastry crust. You should just knead enough so that the dough holds together without cracks.</li>
        <li>8. If you started with cold butter you should be able to see small chunks of butter</li>
        <li>speckling the dough. This is a good thing. These small bits of butter will spread out into layers as the crust cooks so you have a flaky crust!</li>
        <li>9. Sprinkle each disc with a little flour, wrap each one in plastic wrap, and</li>
        <li>refrigerate for one hour or up to 2 days.</li>
        <li>10. Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit for a few minutes: 11. Remove one crust disc from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10</li>
        <li>minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier.</li>
        <li>12. Roll out dough, place in pie dish. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured</li>
        <li>surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li>13. Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it</li>
        <li>lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate.</li>
        <li>14. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge of</li>
        <li>the pie dish. Rolling out an easy pie crust.</li>
        <li>15. Roll out the second disc of dough, as before. Gently place onto the top of the</li>
        <li>filling in the pie.</li>
        <li>16. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold the</li>
        <li>edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together.</li>
        <li>17. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. 18. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking</li>
        <li>pie can escape.</li>
        <li>How to Pre-Bake a Pie Crust</li>
        <li>1. If your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, as many custard pie recipes do, follow</li>
        <li>all the steps above for a single, bottom crust only, without filling.</li>
        <li>2. Freeze the crust it for at least a half hour: 3. until chilled. This is an important step in pre-baking. Otherwise the crust will slip</li>
        <li>down the sides.</li>
        <li>4. Preheat your oven to 350°F. 5. Line pie crust with aluminum foil. When the pie crust is sufficiently chilled, line the</li>
        <li>pie crust with aluminum foil. Let the foil extend over by a few inches on two sides to make it easier to lift to remove the pie weights when the baking is done.</li>
        <li>6. Fill with pie weights. Fill the crust to the top with pie weights - dry beans, rice, or</li>
        <li>sugar. (Sugar works best.)</li>
        <li>7. Bake at 350°F for 45-50 minutes if making a crust for a pie that will require</li>
        <li>further cooking, for example a quiche. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes if making a crust for a pie that you don't need to bake further.</li>
        <li>8. Cool completely before filling. You may need to tent the edges of the pie with</li>
        <li>aluminum foil when you bake your pie, to keep the edges from getting too dried out and burnt.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough:</li>
        <li>1. After the dough has chilled in the refrigerator for an hour, you can take it out to</li>
        <li>roll. If it is too stiff, you may need to let it sit for 5-10 minutes at room temperature before rolling.</li>
        <li>2. Sprinkle a little flour on a flat, clean work surface and on top of the disc of dough</li>
        <li>you intend to roll out. (We use a Tupperware pastry sheet that has the pie circles already marked.)</li>
        <li>3. Using a rolling pin, apply light pressure while rolling outwards from the center of</li>
        <li>the dough.</li>
        <li>4. Every once in a while you may need to gently lift under the dough (a pastry</li>
        <li>scraper works great for this) to make sure it is not sticking.</li>
        <li>5. You have a big enough piece of dough when you place the pie tin or pie dish</li>
        <li>upside down on the dough and the dough extends by at least 2 inches all around.</li>
        <li>6. When the dough has reached the right size, gently fold it in half. Lift up the dough</li>
        <li>and place it so that the folded edge is along the center line of the pie dish. Gently unfold. Do not stretch the dough.</li>
        <li>If single crust pie: trim edges</li>
        <li>● If you are only making a single crust pie, use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the</li>
        <li>dough to within 1/2 inch of the lip of the dish. Tuck the overhang underneath itself</li>
        <li>along the edge of the pie dish. Use your fingers in a pinching motion, or the tines of a fork to crimp the edge of the pie crust.</li>
        <li>If making double crust pie: roll the second crust</li>
        <li>● If you are making a double crust pie, roll out the second disc of dough. Gently</li>
        <li>place onto the top of the filling in the pie. Use kitchen scissors to trim the overhang to an inch over. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Finish the double crust by pressing against the edges of the pie with your finger tips or with a fork.</li>
        <li>Make vents in the top:</li>
        <li>1. Use a sharp knife to cut vents into the top of the pie crust, so the steam has a</li>
        <li>place to escape while the pie is cooking.</li>
        <li>2. Before scoring, you may want to paint the top of your crust with an egg wash</li>
        <li>(this will make a nice finish).</li>
        <li>Egg Wash</li>
        <li>1. A lovely coating for a pie can be achieved with a simple egg wash. Beat egg yolk</li>
        <li>with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.</li>

        <li>(The Easiest) Vegetable Stir Fry</li>
        <li>From https://therecipecritic.com/vegetable-stir-fry/</li>
        <li>Stir fry ingredients I like to stir fry the vegetables that take a little longer to cook first. Like the carrots, mushrooms and baby corn. Then I add in the remainder ingredients. Broccoli, snow peas and the bell peppers do not take as long to cook.</li>
        <li>● Olive Oil ● Vegetables: red bell pepper, yellow bell peppers, sugar snap peas, carrots,</li>
        <li>mushrooms, broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts.</li>
        <li>● Sauce: soy sauce, garlic cloves (minced), brown sugar, sesame oil, chicken</li>
        <li>broth, cornstarch</li>
        <li>● Garnish: green onions and sesame seeds</li>
        <li>How to make vegetable stir fry? The first step is to cook up your veggies. I used a combination of red and yellow peppers, snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms. I also added some baby corn and water chestnuts into the mix for variety. While the veggies are cooking, I make a simple garlic sauce. The sauce gets poured over the veggies then is simmered until thickened. You can enjoy your veggie stir fry as-is, or over rice.</li>
        <li>● Sauté: In a wok or large skillet add 1 Tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add bell pepper, peas, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Sauté 2-3 minutes until veggies are almost tender.</li>
        <li>● Whisk: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, sesame</li>
        <li>oil, chicken broth, and cornstarch.</li>
        <li>● Mix: Pour over veggies and cook until the sauce has thickened. ● Garnish: add chopped green onions and sesame seeds if desired.</li>
        <li>Tips for stir fry</li>
        <li>● To help cook the vegetables at the same rate, make sure to cut into similar and</li>
        <li>smaller sized pieces.</li>
        <li>● Store your vegetable stir fry in the refrigerator for 5 days. You can even meal</li>
        <li>prep!</li>
        <li>● Baby corn and water chestnuts are found in cans down the ethnic food aisles. ● Make ahead the sauce for this vegetable stir fry. It will last in the refrigerator for 3</li>
        <li>days. You can freeze this for later use if needed.</li>

        <li>5. Pour blended chickpeas into soup pot and then stir in the corn, lime juice and</li>
        <li>cilantro. Allow soup to cook and simmer for 5-10 more minutes. Serve with tortilla chips, an extra lime wedge and avocado if you’d like. Serves 4. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Recipe Notes</li>
        <li>Make this in your slow cooker: Making healthy white chicken chili in the slow cooker is EASY. Simply add all ingredients except the lime juice and cilantro to your slow cooker. I also recommend reducing the chicken broth in the recipe by 1 cup as your slow cooker will create condensation and additional liquid as the soup cooks. Cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-7 hours. Remove chicken and shred, then add back to the slow cooker and stir in lime juice and cilantro. Season to taste. That's it!</li>
        <li>To store: this white chicken chili will stay good in your fridge for about 1 week. Once your chili is completely cooled, just place it in an airtight container (or multiple, if you’d like to meal prep it) without the additional toppings and place it in the fridge. To reheat it, simply do so in the microwave with a microwave safe bowl, or feel free to reheat it on the stovetop. Add your toppings once you’re ready to serve!</li>
        <li>To freeze: follow the instructions above, but instead of placing the chili in the refrigerator just put it in your freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw the chili overnight and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave when you’re ready to eat.</li>
        <li>French Lentil Rice Soup</li>
        <li>6 c chicken broth or vegetable broth 1 c lentils, picked over and rinsed 2 medium carrots, peeled and finely diced 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 celery stalks, finely diced 3 TBS uncooked white rice 2 TBS minced garlic 1 tsp herbes de Provence or dried thyme ½ tsp salt 1/8 tsp ground white or black pepper ¼ c heavy cream or sour cream (optional) ¼ c chopped parsley (optional)  Stir together broth, lentils, carrots, onion, celery, rice, garlic, seasoning, salt and pepper in a slow cooker.  Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 to 5 hours.  Remove 1 ½ c soup and puree in a food processor or blender until almost smooth.  Stir pureed soup back into the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Note:  Use caution when processing hot liquids in a blender.  Vent the blender lid and cover with a clean cloth as directed by manufacturer.  Divide soup evenly among 4 serving bowls, garnishing each with cream and parsley if desired.   Note: This is the original recipe.  I found when I made it that the thyme flavor was too strong.  I used 1 ½ times the recipe to make it for my family and I only use ½-3/4 tsp thyme for that amount.  I also usually skip the step that calls for pureeing the soup.</li>
        <li>Pasta Fagioli with Spinach</li>
        <li>Mary Lambert</li>
        <li>Adopted by Rebecca Funk</li>
        <li>3 cans (15 to 19 oz.) Great Northern Beans (or other white beans), rinsed and drained 1lb sweet Italian sausage 1 Tbsp olive oil 2 medium onions, chopped 2 cloves garlic, chopped 2 14-oz cans diced tomatoes with juice 28 oz chicken broth ½ tsp salt 1 rounded cup of any tiny pasta you can find 5 oz.  frozen chopped spinach grated parmesan cheese  Heat a large pot (at least 6 quarts) over medium high heat until hot.  Remove sausage from casings and add to pot, breaking into pieces with a spoon, until browned.  Remove from pot with slotted spoon and set aside.  Reduce heat to medium.  In drippings and olive oil, cook onions until tender and golden, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, cook 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with their juice.  Add chicken broth, salt, beans and two cups of water.  Return sausage to pot.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes.  Just before serving add spinach and pasta.  Simmer until pasta is tender.  Garnish with cheese.  Makes about 16 cups.  Note:  This recipe makes kind of a lot. When I make it for our family, I don’t put pasta in all of it, because the leftovers get mushy.  I usually freeze half of the soup with</li>
        <li>everything in it but the pasta and add it fresh right before eating.  It’s also a great soup because every ingredient is either frozen or a pantry item, so you can always have it on hand for when you’re too lazy to go to the store.</li>

        <li>Homemade Caesar Salad Dressing</li>
        <li>By Jenn Segal , onceuponachef.com, adapted from Gourmet magazine</li>
        <li>My family loves this rich and creamy Caesar salad dressing. It’s not overly garlicky or fishy — it’s just right.</li>
        <li>Servings: Makes 1⅓ cups (enough for about 10 starter salads) Total Time: 10 Minutes</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.</li>
        <li>Note: Anchovy paste can be found near the canned tuna in the supermarket.</li>
        <li>Note: I leave out the anchovy paste and it’s ok to substitute with healthier mayo option, like avocado.</li>
        <li>French Fries (just like the real thing?)</li>
        <li>Preparation Peel 2 lb. large russet potatoes; cut into long french-fry sticks, about 3/8x3/8 inches thick. Rinse; shake off water.  Transfer potatoes to a large deep heavy pot, spreading potatoes so they're no more than 2 layers deep. Pour in safflower or vegetable oil to cover potatoes by 1". Place the pot over medium heat. Cook for 15 minutes (oil will begin bubbling gently). Continue cooking, occasionally loosening potatoes from the bottom of the pot with a heatproof spatula, until potatoes are very tender, 25-30 minutes more. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until golden and crisp, about 15 minutes longer (oil will bubble more vigorously).</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer fries to paper towels to drain. Season with coarse sea salt.</li>

        <li>Oven Roasted Asparagus</li>
        <li>Original recipe makes 4 servings</li>
        <li>1 bunch thin asparagus spears, trimmed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced (optional) (or garlic powder sprinkled on) 1 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (I don’t use anywhere near that much salt and pepper.  I just sprinkle on) 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)  1.   Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2.  Place the asparagus into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with the olive oil. Toss to coat the spears, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange the asparagus onto a baking sheet in a single layer. 3.  Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes depending on thickness. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving.  Cook's Note To remove woody ends, grab stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.</li>
        <li>Roasted New Potatoes</li>
        <li>Cut potatoes in ½. Melt butter in bottom of Pyrex. Put potatoes in. Add seasonings: salt, rosemary, whatever. Microwave until soft or roast in the oven at 400˚ for 20-30</li>
        <li>minutes not covered. Sprinkle it with parmesan at the end and then cover.</li>

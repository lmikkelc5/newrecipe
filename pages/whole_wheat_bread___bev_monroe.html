    <h1>Whole Wheat Bread - Bev Monroe</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>6 c. warm water</p>
        <p>2 T. yeast</p>
        <p>¼ c. oil</p>
        <p>¼ c. lecithin</p>
        <p>½ c. honey</p>
        <p>½ c. gluten powder</p>
        <p>1 T. salt</p>
        <p>2 T. Dough conditioner</p>
        <p>10 c. Whole wheat flour</p>
        <p>Pour the warm water (about 105°) into mixer.  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water.  Using a 1 cup measuring cup, pour ¼ cup oil into the measuring cup first; swirl oil and coat the inside of measure cup.  Pour ½ cup honey into the cup on top of the oil—both will reach ¾ cup line.  Pour both into the mixer (honey will not stick to cup).  Next measure ¼ cup lecithin in the same measuring cup so it will also slide out with less sticking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Now this is the secret of really good bread—set the timer and knead on low speed for at least 10 minutes.  Immediately after kneading, remove dough from mixer, divide into 6 portions.  Spray loaf pans with nonstick spray; shape dough into loaves and put into bread loaf pans.  Let rise until doubled in size—about 40 minutes.  Bake 25 minutes at 350°.  Do not overbake as it dries out bread.  Freeze bread that will not be eaten in one day to keep it moist and fresh.</li>
    </ul>

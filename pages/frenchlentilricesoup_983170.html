    <h1>French Lentil Rice Soup</h1>
    <p>6 c chicken broth or vegetable broth 1 c lentils, picked over and rinsed 2 medium carrots, peeled and finely diced 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 celery stalks, finely diced 3 TBS uncooked white rice 2 TBS minced garlic 1 tsp herbes de Provence or dried thyme ½ tsp salt 1/8 tsp ground white or black pepper ¼ c heavy cream or sour cream (optional) ¼ c chopped parsley (optional)  Stir together broth, lentils, carrots, onion, celery, rice, garlic, seasoning, salt and pepper in a slow cooker.  Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 to 5 hours.  Remove 1 ½ c soup and puree in a food processor or blender until almost smooth.  Stir pureed soup back into the slow cooker.</p>
<p>Note:  Use caution when processing hot liquids in a blender.  Vent the blender lid and cover with a clean cloth as directed by manufacturer.  Divide soup evenly among 4 serving bowls, garnishing each with cream and parsley if desired.   Note: This is the original recipe.  I found when I made it that the thyme flavor was too strong.  I used 1 ½ times the recipe to make it for my family and I only use ½-3/4 tsp thyme for that amount.  I also usually skip the step that calls for pureeing the soup.</p>

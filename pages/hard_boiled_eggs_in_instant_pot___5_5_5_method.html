    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 cup of COLD water in the inner pot of Instant Pot for a 6 quart instant pot and 1.5 cups COLD water for an 8-quart Instant pot.</li>
        <li>Add in egg or steam rack and carefully set as many eggs as desired on or in the rack.</li>
        <li>Place lid on the pressure cooker and set cook time for 5 minutes on high pressure.</li>
        <li>Once cook time has elapsed, let the pressure release for 5 minutes. Then do a quick release and carefully remove eggs from Instant Pot and place in ice water bath.</li>
        <li>Let eggs sit in water bath for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from the water bath.</li>
        <li>Store in the fridge for up to 7 days unpeeled or peel and use within 3 days.</li>
        <li>Equipment Needed</li>
        <li>Electric Pressure Cooker (6 or 8 quart)</li>
        <li>Egg Rack</li>
        <li>Notes</li>
        <li>You can use as few as 1 egg and up to 16 eggs in a 6-quart pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>I find it is best to peel eggs right from the water bath, the shell comes off beautifully every single time.</li>
        <li>To help prevent your eggs from cracking during cooking, let your eggs come to room temperature before pressure cooking.</li>
        <li>Be sure to use cold water, warm water or hot water will change the cooking time.</li>
        <li>If you live at high altitude, be sure to use .</li>

    <h1>Baked Salmon</h1>
    <p>2 cloves garlic, minced 1 ½ - 3 tablespoons light olive oil</p>
<p>1 teaspoon dried basil ½ teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped 3 (6 ounce) filets salmon   DIRECTIONS:</p>
<p>1. In a medium glass bowl, prepare marinade by mixing garlic, light olive oil,</p>
<p>basil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley. Place salmon fillets in a medium glass baking dish, and cover with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator about 1 hour, turning occasionally.  (I didn’t have time to marinate and it was still yummy.)</p>
<p>2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 3. Place fillets in aluminum foil, cover with marinade, and seal.  (I didn’t have</p>
<p>any foil the first time I made it, and it worked fine uncovered.) Place sealed salmon in the glass dish, and bake 35 to 45 minutes, until easily flaked with a fork.  From allrecipes.com 2013.  Called baked salmon II.</p>

    <h1>Lemon Glaze</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest (get zest from lemon before juicing)</p>
        <p>1/4 to 1/3 cup lemon juice*ch we</p>
        <p>2 1/2 cups powdered sugar</p>
        <p>In a medium bowl combine butter, zest, juice, and sugar. Stir until well mixed. Place a piece of wax paper beneath the wire racks where the cookies have been cooling and drizzle glaze over cookies.</p>
        <p>* For best results when using lemons, choose the largest lemon you can find and roll it on the counter for about a minute before juicing in order to get as much juice as possible.  Zest only the yellow part of the lemon peel; the white portion leaves a bitter taste.</p>

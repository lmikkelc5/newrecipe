        <p>3 cans (15 to 19 oz.) Great Northern Beans (or other white beans), rinsed and drained</p>
        <p>1lb sweet Italian sausage</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp olive oil</p>
        <p>2 medium onions, chopped</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
        <p>2 14-oz cans diced tomatoes with juice</p>
        <p>28 oz chicken broth</p>
        <p>Â½ tsp salt</p>
        <p>1 rounded cup of any tiny pasta you can find</p>
        <p>5 oz.  frozen chopped spinach</p>
        <p>grated parmesan cheese</p>
        <p>Heat a large pot (at least 6 quarts) over medium high heat until hot.  Remove sausage from casings and add to pot, breaking into pieces with a spoon, until browned.  Remove from pot with slotted spoon and set aside.  Reduce heat to medium.  In drippings and olive oil, cook onions until tender and golden, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, cook 1 minute.  Add tomatoes with their juice.  Add chicken broth, salt, beans and two cups of water.  Return sausage to pot.  Cover and simmer 30 minutes.  Just before serving add spinach and pasta.  Simmer until pasta is tender.  Garnish with cheese.  Makes about 16 cups.</p>

    <h1>Freezer Salsa (Diana)</h1>
    <div class='metadata'>
        <p>16 cups (4 quarts) tomatoes</p>
        <p>4 green peppers</p>
        <p>4 onions</p>
        <p>4 teaspoons garlic salt</p>
        <p>4 teaspoons sugar</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons red wine vinegar</p>
        <p>4 jalapeno or Anaheim chili (2 or 3 seeds only for mild)</p>
        <p>¼ cup salt</p>
        <p>8 or 10 drops of tabasco sauce</p>
        <p>Enchilada Sauce</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>• 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>• 3 tablespoons flour (whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and gluten-free flour blends all work!)</li>
        <li>• 1 tablespoon ground chili powder (scale back if you're sensitive to spice or using particularly spicy chili powder)</li>
        <li>• 1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>• ½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>• ¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>• ¼ teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
        <li>• Pinch of cinnamon (optional but recommended)</li>
        <li>• 2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>• 2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>• 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>• Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2. In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it's hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don't step away from the stove!</li>
        <li>3. Once it's ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.</li>
        <li>4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)</li>
        <li>5. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas!</li>
        <li>NOTES</li>
        <li>Enchilada sauce recipe adapted from my. spinach artichoke enchiladas.</li>
        <li>STORAGE SUGGESTIONS: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for expansion (don't screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen), or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing).</li>
        <li>MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Just use gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. I tried with Bob's Red Mill brand and it worked great.</li>
        <li>MAKE IT TOMATO FREE: You can omit the tomato paste. You might want to up the spices a bit. The sauce won't taste quite like the enchilada sauce you might buy at the store, but it will still be good!</li>
        <li>CHANGE IT UP: The chili powder, cumin and garlic powder are essential here, but feel free to change up the other spices to suit your preferences.</li>
    </ul>
